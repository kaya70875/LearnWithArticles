{"text": "However, since exercise impacts the brain and body in many different ways, it wasn\u2019t clear whether the effect of exercise was due to hippocampal circuit rewiring by neurogenesis, or other factors. The researchers therefore used two different genetic approaches to assess the impact of newborn neuron integration into the hippocampus, exclusively."},

We use latent growth curve analyses to model the relationship of adolescent loneliness and loneliness change from adolescence to adulthood, with subsequent psychotropic drugs prescription."},

{"text": "\u201cOn any given day, a person may take great pleasure from one or more of these activities, yet people often consume more hedonic goods than they want or than is good for them,\u201d said lead author Stephen Lee Murphy, PhD, of Ghent University."},

{"text": "The researchers believe that this proposed effect, which they called \u201chedonic compensation,\u201d likely applies to other activities beyond eating. For example, people who are distracted while watching a movie or playing a game may be more likely to engage in additional consumption (e.g., checking social media) to compensate for a diminished enjoyment of the original activity."},

{"text": "Both are turned off during\u00a0rapid eye movement\u00a0(REM) sleep and that creates this \u201creally beautiful opportunity for the\u00a0brain\u00a0to engage in processes that are otherwise not doable when we are awake,\u201d explains Dr. Wassing."},
{"text": "There are two main ways we process emotional memory during sleep, he says, and they involve the brain\u2019s hippocampus and amygdala."},
{"text": "Our brains store what we learn each day. This learning is governed by the hippocampus aggregating and cataloging this new information into the \u201cnovelty\u201d memory store as we process it. At the same time, if that new experience is emotional, the amygdala is very active and coupled with the autonomic nervous system\u2014think racing heart, knots in your stomach, skin crawling."},
{"text": "During REM sleep, our brains reactivate these new memories. It is as if the brain replays a summary of what had happened when we experienced the memory. But during REM sleep, when the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems are turned off, these memories can be moved into the \u201cfamiliar\u201d storage without experiencing the physical \u201cfight or flight\u201d response."},
{"text": " That can\u2019t happen while we\u2019re awake or\u2014as is the case for people with sleep disorders\u2014when we don\u2019t get consistent blocks of REM sleep."},
{"text": "Much of what we now know about the way information is processed by the brain comes from the relatively new field of optogenetics which is used to activate or inhibit very specific cell types in a neuronal network. This has allowed researchers to see what cell types and brain regions are involved in encoding emotional memories."},

{"text": "Dr. Redfern explains that while we used to think most emotional development occurred in childhood and was fully formed by around age 7, we now know that this continues into early adulthood."},

{"text": "This emotionally-charged brain can make assumptions that feel like fact \u2013 thoughts like \u2018no one likes me, I am alone\u2019 \u2013 and adolescents are much more likely to slip into these mindsets.
