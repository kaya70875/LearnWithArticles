{"text": " to help slow climate change ("},
{"text": "). Even the space industry wants a piece of the ocean \u2014 to create watery graveyards for defunct spacecraft."},
{"text": "The careening from one ocean ambition to another underscores one of the book\u2019s biggest takeaways: We\u2019ve established a precarious new type of ocean ecosystem, and it is going to be incredibly difficult \u2014 maybe impossible \u2014 to juggle all the priorities while also protecting ocean health and biodiversity."},
{"text": "Consider Trondheim, Norway, where Heffernan visits the SINTEF SeaLab. One of the world\u2019s wealthiest oil states, Norway wants to move its economy away from oil and more toward aquaculture, partly by dramatically increasing the production of its coastal salmon farms. The ocean\u2019s twilight zone, the murky waters that extend from about 100 meters to 1,000 meters below the surface, where sunlight no longer penetrates, could provide an immense untapped resource of feeder fish for those farmed salmon. By at least one estimate, Heffernan writes, the twilight zone contains as much as 95 percent of the ocean\u2019s fish by weight."},
{"text": "But these twilight denizens are also "},
{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). Crustaceans, fish and other creatures rise toward the surface to feed on carbon-bearing plankton at night, and then sink into the depths during the day \u2014 carrying that carbon into the deep."},
{"text": "Such conflicting desires to plunder and protect show up over and over again. Nations urging conservation in one arena may push for increasing exploration or exploitation in another, Heffernan writes. The European Union in 2021, for example, offered subsidies to its fishing fleet to range farther offshore, even as it committed to sustainable fishing. Nations keen to commit to protecting marine life and combating climate change may be the same countries that support deep-sea mining, which may be detrimental to life on the ocean floor."},
{"text": "The problem, Heffernan says, isn\u2019t that the high seas are without any rules. Rather, there\u2019s \u201ca mishmash of organizations and bodies, each using their own rulebook.\u201d Plus, she adds, \u201cI now realize that many of those tasked with governing this space willfully ignore science and disregard expert advice.\u201d"},

After establishing that \u201cFlavor is molecules,\u201d she moves on to \u201cFlavor is taste and smell.\u201d Smell, perhaps counterintuitively, often influences flavor more than taste does, thanks to the numerous smell receptors, she explains. Smell can also evoke emotional memories more intensely than other sensory inputs. Hand-drawn illustrations of the human brain and nasal cavity explain why by showing how nerve cells that line the roof of the nasal cavity detect scent molecules and send signals directly to the limbic system, a part of the brain that handles feelings and memories. Other sensory inputs, in contrast, are first processed in different parts of the brain before arriving at the limbic system."},

{"text": "If you\u2019re like me, perhaps you\u2019ve visited a contemporary art installation, seen a painting of a single plain square or a giant sculpture of a fork, and wondered, how on Earth is this art? I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t dare ask this out loud, for fear of looking gauche. Luckily for us, journalist Bianca Bosker is willing to ask the age-old question \u2014 What is art? \u2014 and go to great lengths, fish-out-of-water style, to find the answer. The result is her latest book, "},
{"text": ", a participatory dive into the art world and the spiritual sustenance that art itself provides."},
{"text": "An art book probably isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect Science News to review. But Bosker wields many tools, including scientific research, to understand"},
{"text": " "},
{"text": "."},
{"text": "She sets out to develop what art disciples call an \u201cEye,\u201d a discerning ability to separate the \u201cgood\u201d art from the \u201cbad.\u201d The only way to do that, she decides, is to embed herself among members of the trade. This is no easy task; the art world is secretive, closed and judgmental. Acolytes are as obsessed about art as they are about maintaining an aura of exclusivity. When Bosker finally penetrates fine art circles, what she finds isn\u2019t pretty. The art world often excludes those who can\u2019t afford to go to art school or the luxury of creating vanity projects. Practitioners often take on multiple jobs to make ends meet; many eventually quit from burnout. On top of that, there\u2019s a culture of top-down bullying."},
{"text": "But as much as Bosker\u2019s experiences might destroy your faith in art, she relentlessly digs deeper until she redeems it, by discovering the fundamental joy that art can bring to both those who create it and view it."},
{"text": "Bosker works as a gallery assistant, art-fair seller, studio helper and museum security guard to examine art from different angles. Each role provides a fascinating vignette into how the art machine operates, and you can\u2019t help but admire Bosker\u2019s willingness to suffer fools. Her can-do attitude puts her in bizarre situations \u2014 she lets a performance artist sit on her face in the name of art \u2014 making for a hilarious expos\u00e9 about the art industry."},
{"text": "While entertaining, the recounting of her exploits means it takes a while for the book to get to the meaning of art. But once it does, science provides several clues. Some experts theorize that prehistoric humans were compelled to paint on cave walls because it showed off the artist\u2019s skills and potential fitness as a mate. One anthropologist has argued that art bound communities together toward common survival."},
{"text": "In today\u2019s world, art\u2019s utility has expanded. Here too, science can help us understand how. Bosker introduces readers to the growing field of neuroaesthetics, the application of neuroscience to study the perception of art. Researchers have demonstrated that seeing is often secondary to believing \u2014 a \u201cfilter of expectation\u201d in our brains distorts the raw data stream of light that hits our eyes. This filter allows us to take mental shortcuts and dismiss certain visual details to rapidly process our chaotic environment. This is why we know a white vase next to the window is still white, even as natural light transforms its exact hue to sunset golden or moonlight gray throughout the day."},
{"text": "One function of art, Bosker writes, is to yank off this filter to reexamine the world with renewed wonder. Art has a therapeutic quality, a fact that\u2019s seized upon by doctors who prescribe patients visits to art museums and the pleasure of hanging wall art. Removing that filter can also help doctors themselves. Over two dozen medical schools require students to study paintings to avert the habit of snap judgment. Studies have shown that trainees who take an art-based visual literacy course perform more holistic physical examinations and read human facial expressions better than those who don\u2019t."},
{"text": "The most scintillating aspect of the book is Bosker herself \u2014 the narrator, the why-person, the self-acknowledged philistine and, most importantly, the reader\u2019s friend. Instead of lecturing from an authoritative vantage point, Bosker lets readers witness at eye level her growing clarity of art\u2019s function. She\u2019s also witty, self-deprecating and isn\u2019t afraid to call out snobbery. In her trips to galleries, she writes, \u201cpretension hung in the air like an unacknowledged fart.\u201d "},
{"text": "In the end, readers don\u2019t get a complete answer for humankind\u2019s compulsion toward art. Bosker instead offers her own interpretation: Art is a way to find beauty and heighten our appreciation for life. In debunking the infallibility of an \u201cEye,\u201d Bosker argues that art is everywhere and can be anything, as long as we\u2019re open to letting what we see move us.

By pressing buttons on an interactive board, visitors can also hear calls that appear to convey fear, affection and annoyance."},

The animals, for instance, hear not just with their ears but also with their feet, picking up on the subtle vibrations of the ground beneath them.

{"text": "The book weeds through chemistry, evolution and world history to explore the origins of toxins and how humans have co-opted them for everything from medicines to spices to pesticides. \u201cThe chemicals in these products of nature are not a sideshow \u2014 they are the main event,\u201d Whiteman writes, \u201cand we\u2019ve unwittingly stolen them from a war raging all around us.\u201d"},
{"text": "That tussle, part of what Charles Darwin called the \u201cwar of nature,\u201d is the innovative ways plants and animals continuously evolve traits that one-up their predators or competitors. Many of the chemicals that we stock in our cabinets and pharmacies, for instance, originated in plants as deterrents against insects snacking on them, Whiteman points out. These chemicals act on our brains and bodies thanks to the surprising neurological similarities between insects and humans."},

{"text": "Take tannins. They show up in a wide array of plants, including oaks, tea plants and grapes. Whiteman muses that these chemical compounds may protect plants by inhibiting the ability of microbes and herbivores to absorb nutrients. Tannins also bind to salivary proteins, resulting in the \u201crough, dry puckering sensation\u201d that many people enjoy while sipping a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Humans have also long put the protein-binding properties of tannins to use in tanning animal hides for leather. For nearly 1,500 years, Europe and then its colonies relied on ink manufactured from tannin-rich oak galls for drafting important documents, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence."},
{"text": "Perhaps the most important role of toxins in the human world can be found in our pantries and medicine cabinets. Whiteman focuses on pharmacological heavyweights such as the antimalarial drug quinine, derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, and salicylates, such as aspirin and oil of wintergreen. Curare, cocaine and scopolamine demonstrate how we\u2019ve wrangled these alkaloids into anesthetics. It\u2019s one of many instances where Whiteman nods to Indigenous communities around the world that have been repeatedly exploited or gone uncompensated for their medicinal discoveries."},

The Columbian exchange, the Opium Wars and the founding of the East India Company are all pit stops along Whiteman\u2019s exploration of how the pursuit of all things psychoactive and medicinal fueled European colonialism. The lasting consequences, Whiteman argues, include infringement on Indigenous rights, global biodiversity loss and the climate crisis."},
{"text": "The opioid epidemic and alcohol use disorder also loom large in the book. Here, Whiteman\u2019s assertion that our use of toxins \u201cwalk[s] a knife\u2019s edge between healing and harm\u201d is loudest. His father haunts many of the personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout the 304-page read. Whether he\u2019s recalling the toxicology report from his father\u2019s autopsy or noting his family\u2019s fondness for black pepper, Whiteman explores grief as much as he does science: \u201cMy attempt to grasp why [my father] died allowed me to identify and then draw together the many ways that nature\u2019s toxins affect the world.\u201d "},

{"text": "For that 1621 Thanksgiving, the complex historic arc goes like this. Up to 90 percent of the Wampanoag population had died from an epidemic brought by a previous wave of European explorers by the time the Pilgrims arrived in December 1620 in what\u2019s now Massachusetts. The weakened community faced threats from an encroaching neighboring tribe. Meanwhile, the Pilgrims, unaccustomed to the new environment and climate, were dying of starvation and disease."},

The Wampanoag people could teach the Pilgrims how to harvest crops and the Pilgrims could protect the Wampanoag people from invaders. The peace did not last. Over the next several decades, the settlers\u2019 population exploded and European leaders displaced the Wampanoag community, often through dishonest or violent means. War broke out in 1675, killing hundreds of colonists and thousands of Native Americans. Settlers killed the Wampanoag leader and displayed his head on a spike for two decades.\u00a0"},

{"text": "As is the case worldwide, glaciers are disappearing in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca mountains at an unprecedented rate. And as the ice shrinks, nearby ecosystems wither: They lose access to summertime supplies of freshwater and sometimes encounter harmful acidic minerals in rocks once covered by the glaciers."},
{"text": "Llamas may help counter some of these effects. Their transformation of the land, as seen in the new study, could reduce rock weathering and help the soil hold onto more moisture, thus limiting the acidic runoff that can poison farmers\u2019 crops.

Nor is rewilding, the push to reintroduce key species to their native ecosystems, unique to the Cordillera Blanca mountains.

And a group in Spain hopes one day to lift the wild bovine known as the auroch out of extinction, putting it to use in grazing."},

{"text": "For one, animal poo is special: It holds onto both moisture and microbes. For another, in grazing and trampling on plants, the llamas weed out dominant plants, making space for new species."},
{"text": "For the new study, Zimmer and colleagues primarily chose to work with llamas rather than another native camelid, the vicu\u00f1a, because llamas are easier to herd and make gentler tramplers. And the farmers that the researchers collaborated with were also particularly invested in restoring llama communities, features of Incan religious rituals. Centuries of Spanish conquest replaced llamas and other wild camelids with foreign livestock that uprooted native plants. Bringing llamas back, the farmers think, might slow or reverse the physical and cultural loss."},
{"text": "Zimmer would like to continue the study for at least a decade to track the full effects of the intervention.

If further research with llamas bears positive results, Zimmer hopes local government actors might invest in llama herding as a potential adaptation strategy. It can\u2019t bring back the glaciers.

Her latest, "},
{"text": ", demonstrates the ways that seemingly na\u00efve questions can unlock fascinating journeys to understanding math for math\u2019s sake, rather than purely in service of real-world applications."},
{"text": "Math has a reputation for supplying concise, black-or-white answers to questions. Getting straightforward math questions right or wrong is often presented as the litmus test of whether someone has mathematical ability. But that view of math is simplistic, Cheng explains. Rather than a tool for obtaining objective right answers, math is a method for asking questions and exploring the possibilities those questions raise."},
{"text": "Students are naturally curious about numbers and patterns, but math classes often teach them that math facts should be accepted without question. For instance, a student might learn that a prime number is defined as a whole number \u2014 a positive number without a fractional or decimal part \u2014 that is only divisible by itself and 1. The number 1, however, is not considered a prime number. If a student asks why not, they will likely be told it just isn\u2019t; deal with it."},
{"text": "But in fact, there is a good reason to exclude 1 from the prime numbers. As Cheng describes, the prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of the whole numbers; every whole number greater than 1 can be broken down as a product of prime numbers. Because multiplying by 1 doesn\u2019t do anything to a number, 1 isn\u2019t needed to build the other whole numbers, at least when multiplication is considered. (For addition, it\u2019s a whole different story.) Excluding 1 from the primes allows us to break every whole number greater than 1 down into a product of primes in only one way \u2014 12 is the product of two copies of 2 and one copy of 3, for example, and cannot be broken down into any different set of primes. If 1 were a prime number, those products would no longer be unique. You could toss any number of 1s into the mix and still get the same product."},
{"text": "Mathematicians have found the uniqueness of these products useful for exploring properties of numbers, so they came to the consensus not to include 1 in the primes about a century ago. Considering the reasons mathematicians define primes precisely the way they do is more interesting than simply accepting the definition so you can get an A on a math test."},
{"text": "The prime number example is just one of many simple questions that Cheng poses in the book to motivate deep dives into the logical foundations of Western mathematics: Why does 1+1 = 2? Why does \u2212(\u22121) = 1? Why does 2+4 = 4+2? And, yes, is math real?

{"text": "As for methane, levels in the air above the city are at least three times as high as those predicted by bottom-up models. But no one knows what causes the excess."},
{"text": "To figure that out, Commane looks for methane relative to other gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ethane. When the sensors pick up large plumes of gas, Commane uses a technique called source attribution to determine how the plumes were produced. Wind speed and plume intensity provide information about the direction to and distance from the source."},
{"text": "Then it\u2019s a matter of hopping into a car or going on foot to measure and confirm the exact location of the emissions with portable sensors, Commane says."},

{"text": "Since Broaden, and armed with better brain-imaging techniques, scientists have learned a lot more about the SCC and how it connects to other parts of the brain.

{"text": "A recent presentation from Mayberg\u2019s research group described the outcomes of about 50 patients from the Broaden trial, people who continued to be stimulated and monitored after the trial officially ended. It turns out that the people who got better had their electrodes implanted in a fortuitous spot in the SCC, one that hit four key white matter tracts. \u201cIt was really about targeting,\u201d Mayberg says."},
{"text": "The SCC \u2014 and the signals it sends to other brain areas \u2014 seems to have a role in generating negative emotions, immobility, cognitive sluggishness and heavy physical feelings. Stimulating there, researchers suspect, can overwhelm those nerve cells, tiring them out and making them effectively fall silent. That silence then has ripple effects at many different levels, from single cells to entire cohorts of brain areas. Those changes, the thinking goes, somehow turn down the negative malaise."},
{"text": "It\u2019s a bit like taking off the parking brake, allowing energy and motivation to flow once more. This aspect of the SCC\u2019s job may explain why Jon went for a walk in the hospital halls and at home with his family, why Amanda felt a spark of energy and why Emily had an itch to get up and go to the library."},
{"text": "But Mayberg and her colleagues at Mount Sinai aren\u2019t the only people conducting trials on DBS for depression, nor is their target the only one under consideration. Another promising target, called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, is more involved in feelings of reward. Stimulating there may be turning up the positive as opposed to dialing down the negative. Its connections to other brain regions are extensive, perhaps even more numerous than the SCC\u2019s."},
{"text": "Some of the big questions, says Sameer Sheth, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, are about personalizing the technique: Which patients would benefit from which target in the brain and what type of stimulation? The SCC and the VC/VS both seem promising. In a way, the debate mirrors a similar one in DBS for Parkinson\u2019s disease, where several brain structures are possible targets. To determine where electrodes should be implanted, doctors now consider factors like how advanced the disease is, whether a patient needs to reduce their medication and if tremor is the main problem."},
{"text": "To better understand the neural circuits related to mood, Sheth and his colleagues are conducting a clinical trial for depression that is using implanted electrodes to listen in on many parts of the brain. The study is designed, in part, to uncover how various types of stimulation, pointed toward various neural spots, affect the brain. Eventually, the team hopes, this knowledge could lead to personalized stimulation \u2014 bespoke electrical patterns tailored to each person. (Sheth has received consulting fees from various medical companies, including Boston Scientific and NeuroPace, and cofounded a neurotechnology company.)"},

As such, he became Patient 001, a designation he grew fond of, he says. He traveled to Houston from New York City, where he was living at the time, and was scheduled for surgery on March 9, 2020. His surgery squeaked through, just days before all nonemergency surgeries were canceled in the area because of the growing COVID pandemic."},
{"text": "During surgery at Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Houston, Patient 001 was implanted with four electrode wires, two in the SCC and two in the VC/VS.

These extras were temporary, there only to listen to his brain activity over a 10-day stay in the hospital. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say the 10-day stay in the hospital was a walk in the park, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you have nothing to lose and you\u2019re in hell, you\u2019ll do anything.\u201d"},

{"text": "The origins of this book date back to 2013, when I was on a reporting trip about habitat connectivity.

The sun was going down on this beautiful October evening, and it was just incredibly inspiring to be on top of this piece of infrastructure that humans had built for wild animals. We do so much on this planet to make animals\u2019 lives more difficult, and as a conservation journalist, it felt like a form of ecological empathy manifested as a science."},
{"text": " It\u2019s where the field of road ecology is going in a lot of ways. A lot of the early history is focused on deer because that\u2019s what safety-oriented engineers worry about. But as the field has evolved [to become more focused on conservation than human safety], it\u2019s gotten more concerned with less charismatic, less dangerous organisms. They are important to think of because in some ways they\u2019re the taxa most harmed by roads."},
{"text": " One of the biggest takeaways is just how deleterious road noise pollution is. When you read the literature about the health effects and the ecological effects of road noise, you realize that it\u2019s truly one of the great unsung public health crises of our time. It\u2019s elevating our cortisol levels, raising our blood pressure, and making us more susceptible to cardiac disease and stroke."},
{"text": " "},
{"text": " The climate movement has evolved a lot over the last decade away from individual blaming and towards indicting larger corporate power structures. The same holds true in the world of road ecology. Most of us have had the experience of hitting wild animals. I\u2019ve killed animals, unfortunately, and I always feel incredibly guilty about it and complicit in this car culture. But car culture is the product of this very intensive marketing campaign that the whole automotive industrial complex has waged."},
{"text": "Instead of blaming drivers for roadkill, the real answers are these larger systemic solutions. Maybe that\u2019s modifying infrastructure to build more wildlife crossings to make highways permeable; maybe it means improved mass transit systems."},
{"text": " "},
{"text": " The parallels between the ways that roads impact ecological communities and the ways they impact human communities are striking. Highways are forces of division in both ecosystems and cities, and we humans fall victim to cars, just as wild animals do. But I also wanted to recognize that we\u2019re not all harmed equally \u2014 roads, especially urban freeways, have been very deliberately weaponized against communities of color throughout the last century.

This old viaduct will be torn down in recognition of the disproportionate harms that it inflicted on people of color."},

{"text": "Here\u2019s what to know about downbursts."},
{"text": "A "},
{"text": " produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. When the downdraft reaches the ground, it slams into the surface and spreads out, sending winds outward in all directions like a water balloon dropped from the sky."},
{"text": "Every storm has a downdraft which sends cold air toward the ground and along the surface, says Charles Kuster, a research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. But for that downdraft to create a downburst, it needs to reach a certain velocity. There are a few different thresholds in use, but a common indicator is wind speeds above 93 kilometers per hour (58 miles per hour), which is also the wind speed that merits a severe thunderstorm warning from the National Weather Service."},
{"text": "Downbursts can come in two varieties: microbursts, which affect an area smaller than 4 kilometers wide, and macrobursts, which affect a larger area."},
{"text": "Downbursts need two things to form: a favorable storm environment and a strong cooling mechanism. Humidity that increases with altitude and a large temperature difference between the storm and the surrounding environment both create favorable conditions for a downburst, as does high precipitation loading \u2014 the amount of rain or hail being held aloft by upward winds feeding into the storm."},
{"text": "The cooling mechanism can take a few different forms. Melting hail or evaporating rain in the atmosphere can cool the surrounding air because those processes require energy. Djordje Romanic, an atmospheric scientist at McGill University in Montreal, likens this cooling effect to stepping out of a hot shower. \u201cYou run across the room to get your towel, and you\u2019re cold, but you just took a warm shower,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible because that water is evaporating, and evaporation takes energy\u201d in the form of heat. The mass of dense, cooled air eventually becomes too heavy for the upward winds to keep it aloft and it falls to the earth, creating a downburst."},
{"text": "Downbursts are an area of powerful winds produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. Downbursts smash into the ground and radiate outward. Wind speeds when a downburst strikes can rival a weak tornado."},
{"text": "Downbursts don\u2019t require rain, though. While \u201cwet\u201d downbursts are common across the southern United States, less humid western states more often experience \u201cdry\u201d downbursts. In certain cases, rain evaporates in the dry atmosphere before it hits the ground, cooling the air inside the storm."},
{"text": "Often when a downburst strikes, affected residents ascribe the damage to a tornado \u2014 and one could be forgiven for the mistake. Downbursts can generate winds that are about as powerful as a weak tornado, Romanic says. But the parallels end there. A tornado\u2019s "},
{"text": " requires high wind shear \u2014 changes in wind speed or direction at different altitudes \u2014 to drive its rotation ("},
{"text": "). By contrast, downbursts require low wind shear to keep from tearing the blob of lofted, cooler air apart."},
{"text": "Patterns of damage differ between the two as well, says Mark Rose, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. A tornado\u2019s rotating winds will send debris in a swirling pattern, while the straight-line winds of a downburst tend to cause damage along a single direction."},
{"text": "Any area that has thunderstorms can encounter a downburst, though not every storm will produce these strong winds, Kuster says. Because downbursts \u201cdevelop quickly and dissipate quickly,\u201d he says, the damaging winds can strike with little to no warning."},
{"text": "Storms with the potential to produce downbursts can be detected by radar, which shows the location and the approximate speed of a storm\u2019s most intense winds, Rose says. But because the radar grid is larger than a typical downburst, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly when and where a downburst will strike, Romanic says. "},
{"text": ", he and colleagues reported in "},
{"text": "in 2022."},
{"text": "The National Severe Storms Laboratory is studying a type of radar technology called "},
{"text": " that could detect signs of an imminent downburst minutes before the downburst hits maximum intensity, potentially giving people in the affected area a few extra moments to prepare."},
{"text": "It\u2019s hard to say. Reports of downbursts have increased over the years, but Romanic cautions that much of that increase could be tied to improvements in detection via radar, and to the greater potential for damage as cities have grown. After accounting for those factors, there hasn\u2019t been a significant increase in downbursts since the 1990s, he says."},
{"text": "But that doesn\u2019t mean extra heat has no effect on downbursts. Anything that increases a storm\u2019s energy increases the likelihood of severe winds, Kuster says. That includes higher temperatures and more humidity. As summers get hotter, the planet could see more storms with the potential to produce downbursts, researchers suspect."},
{"text": "For now, Kuster emphasizes that while downbursts may not be as common as a typical thunderstorm or as well-known as a tornado, they are still hazardous. \u201cDownbursts are serious.

These cold spots exist where oceanic plates subduct, or sink below more buoyant tectonic plates, into the mantle.

Mantle simulations suggest that after the supersized landmass has formed, the incessant inward pull ceases as new subduction zones initiate at the coastlines of the supercontinent. Somewhere in the interior of the supercontinent, hot mantle rises, eventually causing the supercontinent to tear, forming new oceans and beginning another cycle."},

The outer layer is made of white silica fibers that reflect visible light, coated with hexagonal boron nitride, a ceramic material that reflects ultraviolet light and helps dissipate heat. Together, the silica fibers and boron nitride reflect 96 percent of the sunlight that hits the fabric. At the same time, the outer layer absorbs heat from the surrounding area and emits that energy as infrared light, which also lowers the temperature under the cloak through a process called radiative cooling."},
{"text": "Though the outer layer keeps the space under the cloak cooler for longer than an uncovered area, the cloaked space slowly warms up throughout the day. The inner layer, made of aluminum foil, keeps the space warm at night by trapping some of that heat inside, similar to an insulating survival blanket."},
