{"text": "The book begins by churning rapidly through the waves of history that brought us to today, including how we even define the high seas: all ocean waters more than 200 nautical miles from any country\u2019s coastline. In many ways, the modern ocean grab was set in motion some 400 years ago. A bitter feud between Dutch and Portuguese traders culminated in a legal document called the "},

{"text": "). Others are searching for new medicines in the DNA of deep-sea microbes, sponges or sea lilies. Still others are exploring "},
{"text": " to help slow climate change ("},
{"text": "). Even the space industry wants a piece of the ocean \u2014 to create watery graveyards for defunct spacecraft."},
{"text": "The careening from one ocean ambition to another underscores one of the book\u2019s biggest takeaways: We\u2019ve established a precarious new type of ocean ecosystem, and it is going to be incredibly difficult \u2014 maybe impossible \u2014 to juggle all the priorities while also protecting ocean health and biodiversity."},
{"text": "Consider Trondheim, Norway, where Heffernan visits the SINTEF SeaLab. One of the world\u2019s wealthiest oil states, Norway wants to move its economy away from oil and more toward aquaculture, partly by dramatically increasing the production of its coastal salmon farms. The ocean\u2019s twilight zone, the murky waters that extend from about 100 meters to 1,000 meters below the surface, where sunlight no longer penetrates, could provide an immense untapped resource of feeder fish for those farmed salmon. By at least one estimate, Heffernan writes, the twilight zone contains as much as 95 percent of the ocean\u2019s fish by weight."},
{"text": "But these twilight denizens are also "},
{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). Crustaceans, fish and other creatures rise toward the surface to feed on carbon-bearing plankton at night, and then sink into the depths during the day \u2014 carrying that carbon into the deep."},
{"text": "Such conflicting desires to plunder and protect show up over and over again. Nations urging conservation in one arena may push for increasing exploration or exploitation in another, Heffernan writes. The European Union in 2021, for example, offered subsidies to its fishing fleet to range farther offshore, even as it committed to sustainable fishing. Nations keen to commit to protecting marine life and combating climate change may be the same countries that support deep-sea mining, which may be detrimental to life on the ocean floor."},
{"text": "The problem, Heffernan says, isn\u2019t that the high seas are without any rules. Rather, there\u2019s \u201ca mishmash of organizations and bodies, each using their own rulebook.\u201d Plus, she adds, \u201cI now realize that many of those tasked with governing this space willfully ignore science and disregard expert advice.\u201d"},
{"text": "There are global efforts afoot to establish uniform, consistent regulations on ocean activities.

After establishing that \u201cFlavor is molecules,\u201d she moves on to \u201cFlavor is taste and smell.\u201d Smell, perhaps counterintuitively, often influences flavor more than taste does, thanks to the numerous smell receptors, she explains. Smell can also evoke emotional memories more intensely than other sensory inputs. Hand-drawn illustrations of the human brain and nasal cavity explain why by showing how nerve cells that line the roof of the nasal cavity detect scent molecules and send signals directly to the limbic system, a part of the brain that handles feelings and memories. Other sensory inputs, in contrast, are first processed in different parts of the brain before arriving at the limbic system."},

I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t dare ask this out loud, for fear of looking gauche. Luckily for us, journalist Bianca Bosker is willing to ask the age-old question \u2014 What is art? \u2014 and go to great lengths, fish-out-of-water style, to find the answer. The result is her latest book, "},
{"text": ", a participatory dive into the art world and the spiritual sustenance that art itself provides."},
{"text": "An art book probably isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect Science News to review. But Bosker wields many tools, including scientific research, to understand"},
{"text": " "},
{"text": "."},
{"text": "She sets out to develop what art disciples call an \u201cEye,\u201d a discerning ability to separate the \u201cgood\u201d art from the \u201cbad.\u201d The only way to do that, she decides, is to embed herself among members of the trade. This is no easy task; the art world is secretive, closed and judgmental. Acolytes are as obsessed about art as they are about maintaining an aura of exclusivity. When Bosker finally penetrates fine art circles, what she finds isn\u2019t pretty. The art world often excludes those who can\u2019t afford to go to art school or the luxury of creating vanity projects. Practitioners often take on multiple jobs to make ends meet; many eventually quit from burnout. On top of that, there\u2019s a culture of top-down bullying."},
{"text": "But as much as Bosker\u2019s experiences might destroy your faith in art, she relentlessly digs deeper until she redeems it, by discovering the fundamental joy that art can bring to both those who create it and view it."},
{"text": "Bosker works as a gallery assistant, art-fair seller, studio helper and museum security guard to examine art from different angles. Each role provides a fascinating vignette into how the art machine operates, and you can\u2019t help but admire Bosker\u2019s willingness to suffer fools. Her can-do attitude puts her in bizarre situations \u2014 she lets a performance artist sit on her face in the name of art \u2014 making for a hilarious expos\u00e9 about the art industry."},
{"text": "While entertaining, the recounting of her exploits means it takes a while for the book to get to the meaning of art. But once it does, science provides several clues. Some experts theorize that prehistoric humans were compelled to paint on cave walls because it showed off the artist\u2019s skills and potential fitness as a mate. One anthropologist has argued that art bound communities together toward common survival."},
{"text": "In today\u2019s world, art\u2019s utility has expanded. Here too, science can help us understand how. Bosker introduces readers to the growing field of neuroaesthetics, the application of neuroscience to study the perception of art. Researchers have demonstrated that seeing is often secondary to believing \u2014 a \u201cfilter of expectation\u201d in our brains distorts the raw data stream of light that hits our eyes. This filter allows us to take mental shortcuts and dismiss certain visual details to rapidly process our chaotic environment. This is why we know a white vase next to the window is still white, even as natural light transforms its exact hue to sunset golden or moonlight gray throughout the day."},
{"text": "One function of art, Bosker writes, is to yank off this filter to reexamine the world with renewed wonder. Art has a therapeutic quality, a fact that\u2019s seized upon by doctors who prescribe patients visits to art museums and the pleasure of hanging wall art. Removing that filter can also help doctors themselves. Over two dozen medical schools require students to study paintings to avert the habit of snap judgment. Studies have shown that trainees who take an art-based visual literacy course perform more holistic physical examinations and read human facial expressions better than those who don\u2019t."},
{"text": "The most scintillating aspect of the book is Bosker herself \u2014 the narrator, the why-person, the self-acknowledged philistine and, most importantly, the reader\u2019s friend. Instead of lecturing from an authoritative vantage point, Bosker lets readers witness at eye level her growing clarity of art\u2019s function. She\u2019s also witty, self-deprecating and isn\u2019t afraid to call out snobbery. In her trips to galleries, she writes, \u201cpretension hung in the air like an unacknowledged fart.\u201d "},
{"text": "In the end, readers don\u2019t get a complete answer for humankind\u2019s compulsion toward art. Bosker instead offers her own interpretation: Art is a way to find beauty and heighten our appreciation for life. In debunking the infallibility of an \u201cEye,\u201d Bosker argues that art is everywhere and can be anything, as long as we\u2019re open to letting what we see move us.

In the last two years, [the project] has included the ways in which misinformation also compounds individual grief and more collective mourning."},

People were left to wonder, \u201cwas my loved one aware? Were they confused? Were they in pain?\u201d [After the death], not being able to have people into one\u2019s home, not being able to go out.

Instead, people\u2019s immunity to the virus \u2014 from vaccination, prior infections or both \u2014 and human behavior will determine when COVID season hits, he predicts."},

By pressing buttons on an interactive board, visitors can also hear calls that appear to convey fear, affection and annoyance."},

The impetus, Morford says, was to \u201cgive us a reference for how rapidly things are changing across biomes that we care about.\u201d"},

Finding earlier imagery of large landscapes was expensive and time-consuming.

A monoculture of these water-guzzling trees is bad news for local biodiversity and increases the risk of catastrophic wildfire."},

{"text": "The book weeds through chemistry, evolution and world history to explore the origins of toxins and how humans have co-opted them for everything from medicines to spices to pesticides. \u201cThe chemicals in these products of nature are not a sideshow \u2014 they are the main event,\u201d Whiteman writes, \u201cand we\u2019ve unwittingly stolen them from a war raging all around us.\u201d"},
{"text": "That tussle, part of what Charles Darwin called the \u201cwar of nature,\u201d is the innovative ways plants and animals continuously evolve traits that one-up their predators or competitors. Many of the chemicals that we stock in our cabinets and pharmacies, for instance, originated in plants as deterrents against insects snacking on them, Whiteman points out. These chemicals act on our brains and bodies thanks to the surprising neurological similarities between insects and humans."},
{"text": "Whiteman, who studies how insects adapt to plant toxins, is a knowledgeable tour guide through this greenhouse of poisons and cures. And it is a greenhouse. Though people put some animal-made toxins to use, the plant derivatives steal the show."},
{"text": "Chrysanthemums with their insecticidal compound, pyrethrin, make an appearance in the book, as do terpenoid-wafting pines, calming chamomile and morphine-like water lilies. To tame the tangle of chemicals and their interactions, Whiteman dedicates each chapter to a couple of toxin classes and lays out their source in the natural world, their chemical mechanisms and historical context for their use by people."},
{"text": "Take tannins. They show up in a wide array of plants, including oaks, tea plants and grapes. Whiteman muses that these chemical compounds may protect plants by inhibiting the ability of microbes and herbivores to absorb nutrients. Tannins also bind to salivary proteins, resulting in the \u201crough, dry puckering sensation\u201d that many people enjoy while sipping a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Humans have also long put the protein-binding properties of tannins to use in tanning animal hides for leather. For nearly 1,500 years, Europe and then its colonies relied on ink manufactured from tannin-rich oak galls for drafting important documents, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence."},
{"text": "Perhaps the most important role of toxins in the human world can be found in our pantries and medicine cabinets. Whiteman focuses on pharmacological heavyweights such as the antimalarial drug quinine, derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, and salicylates, such as aspirin and oil of wintergreen. Curare, cocaine and scopolamine demonstrate how we\u2019ve wrangled these alkaloids into anesthetics. It\u2019s one of many instances where Whiteman nods to Indigenous communities around the world that have been repeatedly exploited or gone uncompensated for their medicinal discoveries."},
{"text": "\u201cIt is no wonder that many countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the global tropics now have biopiracy laws that strictly regulate the export of natural products,\u201d Whiteman notes."},

The lasting consequences, Whiteman argues, include infringement on Indigenous rights, global biodiversity loss and the climate crisis."},

Here, Whiteman\u2019s assertion that our use of toxins \u201cwalk[s] a knife\u2019s edge between healing and harm\u201d is loudest. His father haunts many of the personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout the 304-page read. Whether he\u2019s recalling the toxicology report from his father\u2019s autopsy or noting his family\u2019s fondness for black pepper, Whiteman explores grief as much as he does science: \u201cMy attempt to grasp why [my father] died allowed me to identify and then draw together the many ways that nature\u2019s toxins affect the world.\u201d "},

{"text": "For that 1621 Thanksgiving, the complex historic arc goes like this. Up to 90 percent of the Wampanoag population had died from an epidemic brought by a previous wave of European explorers by the time the Pilgrims arrived in December 1620 in what\u2019s now Massachusetts. The weakened community faced threats from an encroaching neighboring tribe. Meanwhile, the Pilgrims, unaccustomed to the new environment and climate, were dying of starvation and disease."},
{"text": "In March 1621, those struggling groups formed an alliance. The Wampanoag people could teach the Pilgrims how to harvest crops and the Pilgrims could protect the Wampanoag people from invaders. The peace did not last. Over the next several decades, the settlers\u2019 population exploded and European leaders displaced the Wampanoag community, often through dishonest or violent means. War broke out in 1675, killing hundreds of colonists and thousands of Native Americans. Settlers killed the Wampanoag leader and displayed his head on a spike for two decades.\u00a0"},

Centuries of Spanish conquest replaced llamas and other wild camelids with foreign livestock that uprooted native plants.

Her latest, "},
{"text": ", demonstrates the ways that seemingly na\u00efve questions can unlock fascinating journeys to understanding math for math\u2019s sake, rather than purely in service of real-world applications."},
{"text": "Math has a reputation for supplying concise, black-or-white answers to questions. Getting straightforward math questions right or wrong is often presented as the litmus test of whether someone has mathematical ability. But that view of math is simplistic, Cheng explains. Rather than a tool for obtaining objective right answers, math is a method for asking questions and exploring the possibilities those questions raise."},
{"text": "Students are naturally curious about numbers and patterns, but math classes often teach them that math facts should be accepted without question. For instance, a student might learn that a prime number is defined as a whole number \u2014 a positive number without a fractional or decimal part \u2014 that is only divisible by itself and 1. The number 1, however, is not considered a prime number. If a student asks why not, they will likely be told it just isn\u2019t; deal with it."},
{"text": "But in fact, there is a good reason to exclude 1 from the prime numbers. As Cheng describes, the prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of the whole numbers; every whole number greater than 1 can be broken down as a product of prime numbers. Because multiplying by 1 doesn\u2019t do anything to a number, 1 isn\u2019t needed to build the other whole numbers, at least when multiplication is considered. (For addition, it\u2019s a whole different story.) Excluding 1 from the primes allows us to break every whole number greater than 1 down into a product of primes in only one way \u2014 12 is the product of two copies of 2 and one copy of 3, for example, and cannot be broken down into any different set of primes. If 1 were a prime number, those products would no longer be unique. You could toss any number of 1s into the mix and still get the same product."},
{"text": "Mathematicians have found the uniqueness of these products useful for exploring properties of numbers, so they came to the consensus not to include 1 in the primes about a century ago. Considering the reasons mathematicians define primes precisely the way they do is more interesting than simply accepting the definition so you can get an A on a math test."},

Why does \u2212(\u22121) = 1? Why does 2+4 = 4+2? And, yes, is math real?

{"text": "So, what\u2019s different now?"},
{"text": "Since Broaden, and armed with better brain-imaging techniques, scientists have learned a lot more about the SCC and how it connects to other parts of the brain. The area is not a uniform glob of brain tissue; it holds a confluence of diverse white matter tracts, nerve bundles that speed information to and fro.\u00a0"},
{"text": "A recent presentation from Mayberg\u2019s research group described the outcomes of about 50 patients from the Broaden trial, people who continued to be stimulated and monitored after the trial officially ended. It turns out that the people who got better had their electrodes implanted in a fortuitous spot in the SCC, one that hit four key white matter tracts. \u201cIt was really about targeting,\u201d Mayberg says."},
{"text": "The SCC \u2014 and the signals it sends to other brain areas \u2014 seems to have a role in generating negative emotions, immobility, cognitive sluggishness and heavy physical feelings. Stimulating there, researchers suspect, can overwhelm those nerve cells, tiring them out and making them effectively fall silent. That silence then has ripple effects at many different levels, from single cells to entire cohorts of brain areas. Those changes, the thinking goes, somehow turn down the negative malaise."},
{"text": "It\u2019s a bit like taking off the parking brake, allowing energy and motivation to flow once more. This aspect of the SCC\u2019s job may explain why Jon went for a walk in the hospital halls and at home with his family, why Amanda felt a spark of energy and why Emily had an itch to get up and go to the library."},
{"text": "But Mayberg and her colleagues at Mount Sinai aren\u2019t the only people conducting trials on DBS for depression, nor is their target the only one under consideration. Another promising target, called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, is more involved in feelings of reward. Stimulating there may be turning up the positive as opposed to dialing down the negative. Its connections to other brain regions are extensive, perhaps even more numerous than the SCC\u2019s."},
{"text": "Some of the big questions, says Sameer Sheth, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, are about personalizing the technique: Which patients would benefit from which target in the brain and what type of stimulation? The SCC and the VC/VS both seem promising. In a way, the debate mirrors a similar one in DBS for Parkinson\u2019s disease, where several brain structures are possible targets. To determine where electrodes should be implanted, doctors now consider factors like how advanced the disease is, whether a patient needs to reduce their medication and if tremor is the main problem."},
{"text": "To better understand the neural circuits related to mood, Sheth and his colleagues are conducting a clinical trial for depression that is using implanted electrodes to listen in on many parts of the brain. The study is designed, in part, to uncover how various types of stimulation, pointed toward various neural spots, affect the brain. Eventually, the team hopes, this knowledge could lead to personalized stimulation \u2014 bespoke electrical patterns tailored to each person. (Sheth has received consulting fees from various medical companies, including Boston Scientific and NeuroPace, and cofounded a neurotechnology company.)"},

As such, he became Patient 001, a designation he grew fond of, he says. He traveled to Houston from New York City, where he was living at the time, and was scheduled for surgery on March 9, 2020. His surgery squeaked through, just days before all nonemergency surgeries were canceled in the area because of the growing COVID pandemic."},

{"text": " spoke with Goldfarb about roads and how to minimize their harm. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. "},
{"text": "The origins of this book date back to 2013, when I was on a reporting trip about habitat connectivity. I caught wind of wildlife crossings on Highway 93 in northern Montana, and I ended up taking a tour of them with Marcel Huijser, a wonderful road ecologist at the Western Transportation Institute in Montana."},
{"text": "The most powerful moment of that tour was when we moved to the one big wildlife overpass on Highway 93. The sun was going down on this beautiful October evening, and it was just incredibly inspiring to be on top of this piece of infrastructure that humans had built for wild animals. We do so much on this planet to make animals\u2019 lives more difficult, and as a conservation journalist, it felt like a form of ecological empathy manifested as a science."},
{"text": " It\u2019s where the field of road ecology is going in a lot of ways. A lot of the early history is focused on deer because that\u2019s what safety-oriented engineers worry about. But as the field has evolved [to become more focused on conservation than human safety], it\u2019s gotten more concerned with less charismatic, less dangerous organisms. They are important to think of because in some ways they\u2019re the taxa most harmed by roads."},
{"text": " One of the biggest takeaways is just how deleterious road noise pollution is. When you read the literature about the health effects and the ecological effects of road noise, you realize that it\u2019s truly one of the great unsung public health crises of our time. It\u2019s elevating our cortisol levels, raising our blood pressure, and making us more susceptible to cardiac disease and stroke."},
{"text": " "},
{"text": " The climate movement has evolved a lot over the last decade away from individual blaming and towards indicting larger corporate power structures. The same holds true in the world of road ecology. Most of us have had the experience of hitting wild animals. I\u2019ve killed animals, unfortunately, and I always feel incredibly guilty about it and complicit in this car culture. But car culture is the product of this very intensive marketing campaign that the whole automotive industrial complex has waged."},
{"text": "Instead of blaming drivers for roadkill, the real answers are these larger systemic solutions. Maybe that\u2019s modifying infrastructure to build more wildlife crossings to make highways permeable; maybe it means improved mass transit systems."},
{"text": " "},
{"text": " The parallels between the ways that roads impact ecological communities and the ways they impact human communities are striking. Highways are forces of division in both ecosystems and cities, and we humans fall victim to cars, just as wild animals do. But I also wanted to recognize that we\u2019re not all harmed equally \u2014 roads, especially urban freeways, have been very deliberately weaponized against communities of color throughout the last century. And that\u2019s still happening today."},

The Forest Service, one of the world\u2019s largest road managers, is decommissioning thousands of roads, recognizing that they still have harmful ecological effects. On the other end of the spectrum, you have places like Syracuse, where an urban freeway was punched through the middle of the city, deliberately wiping out a Black neighborhood. This old viaduct will be torn down in recognition of the disproportionate harms that it inflicted on people of color."},

{"text": "Here\u2019s what to know about downbursts."},
{"text": "A "},
{"text": " produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. When the downdraft reaches the ground, it slams into the surface and spreads out, sending winds outward in all directions like a water balloon dropped from the sky."},
{"text": "Every storm has a downdraft which sends cold air toward the ground and along the surface, says Charles Kuster, a research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. But for that downdraft to create a downburst, it needs to reach a certain velocity. There are a few different thresholds in use, but a common indicator is wind speeds above 93 kilometers per hour (58 miles per hour), which is also the wind speed that merits a severe thunderstorm warning from the National Weather Service."},
{"text": "Downbursts can come in two varieties: microbursts, which affect an area smaller than 4 kilometers wide, and macrobursts, which affect a larger area."},
{"text": "Downbursts need two things to form: a favorable storm environment and a strong cooling mechanism. Humidity that increases with altitude and a large temperature difference between the storm and the surrounding environment both create favorable conditions for a downburst, as does high precipitation loading \u2014 the amount of rain or hail being held aloft by upward winds feeding into the storm."},
{"text": "The cooling mechanism can take a few different forms. Melting hail or evaporating rain in the atmosphere can cool the surrounding air because those processes require energy. Djordje Romanic, an atmospheric scientist at McGill University in Montreal, likens this cooling effect to stepping out of a hot shower. \u201cYou run across the room to get your towel, and you\u2019re cold, but you just took a warm shower,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible because that water is evaporating, and evaporation takes energy\u201d in the form of heat. The mass of dense, cooled air eventually becomes too heavy for the upward winds to keep it aloft and it falls to the earth, creating a downburst."},
{"text": "Downbursts are an area of powerful winds produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. Downbursts smash into the ground and radiate outward. Wind speeds when a downburst strikes can rival a weak tornado."},
{"text": "Downbursts don\u2019t require rain, though. While \u201cwet\u201d downbursts are common across the southern United States, less humid western states more often experience \u201cdry\u201d downbursts. In certain cases, rain evaporates in the dry atmosphere before it hits the ground, cooling the air inside the storm."},
{"text": "Often when a downburst strikes, affected residents ascribe the damage to a tornado \u2014 and one could be forgiven for the mistake. Downbursts can generate winds that are about as powerful as a weak tornado, Romanic says. But the parallels end there. A tornado\u2019s "},
{"text": " requires high wind shear \u2014 changes in wind speed or direction at different altitudes \u2014 to drive its rotation ("},
{"text": "). By contrast, downbursts require low wind shear to keep from tearing the blob of lofted, cooler air apart."},
{"text": "Patterns of damage differ between the two as well, says Mark Rose, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. A tornado\u2019s rotating winds will send debris in a swirling pattern, while the straight-line winds of a downburst tend to cause damage along a single direction."},
{"text": "Any area that has thunderstorms can encounter a downburst, though not every storm will produce these strong winds, Kuster says. Because downbursts \u201cdevelop quickly and dissipate quickly,\u201d he says, the damaging winds can strike with little to no warning."},
{"text": "Storms with the potential to produce downbursts can be detected by radar, which shows the location and the approximate speed of a storm\u2019s most intense winds, Rose says. But because the radar grid is larger than a typical downburst, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly when and where a downburst will strike, Romanic says. "},
{"text": ", he and colleagues reported in "},
{"text": "in 2022."},
{"text": "The National Severe Storms Laboratory is studying a type of radar technology called "},
{"text": " that could detect signs of an imminent downburst minutes before the downburst hits maximum intensity, potentially giving people in the affected area a few extra moments to prepare."},
{"text": "It\u2019s hard to say. Reports of downbursts have increased over the years, but Romanic cautions that much of that increase could be tied to improvements in detection via radar, and to the greater potential for damage as cities have grown. After accounting for those factors, there hasn\u2019t been a significant increase in downbursts since the 1990s, he says."},
{"text": "But that doesn\u2019t mean extra heat has no effect on downbursts. Anything that increases a storm\u2019s energy increases the likelihood of severe winds, Kuster says. That includes higher temperatures and more humidity. As summers get hotter, the planet could see more storms with the potential to produce downbursts, researchers suspect."},
{"text": "For now, Kuster emphasizes that while downbursts may not be as common as a typical thunderstorm or as well-known as a tornado, they are still hazardous. \u201cDownbursts are serious.

The mantle regulates the relationship between the crust and Earth\u2019s core, which stores primordial heat.

These cold spots exist where oceanic plates subduct, or sink below more buoyant tectonic plates, into the mantle.

Mantle simulations suggest that after the supersized landmass has formed, the incessant inward pull ceases as new subduction zones initiate at the coastlines of the supercontinent. Somewhere in the interior of the supercontinent, hot mantle rises, eventually causing the supercontinent to tear, forming new oceans and beginning another cycle."},

He had written that \u201cpsycho-therapeutics would seem to be the oldest branch of medicine.\u201d"},
{"text": "Rivers struck colleagues and those he treated as forceful but caring, demanding but sympathetic. Sassoon wrote that he liked and trusted Rivers within minutes of meeting him. After listening to Sassoon relate his traumatic war experiences, Rivers focused on the soldier\u2019s memory and imagination as key healing elements."},
{"text": "Rivers encouraged Sassoon to use poetry to memorialize friends and soldiers he had commanded but who had not survived. As verses of remembrance and grief accumulated, Sassoon achieved a measure of control over the war\u2019s terror and futility. Feeling a sense of guilt and responsibility for soldiers still fighting, Sassoon returned to the war."},
{"text": "Psychotherapy as practiced by Rivers had roots in the powers of suggestion wielded millennia earlier by priests and sorcerers, Jamison writes.

{"text": " (now "},
{"text": "), about what we can learn from pests and how we can co\u00adexist with them. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. "},
{"text": " I wrote a news story that was "},
{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). [It was based on a study] showing that we\u2019ve had house mice since we\u2019ve had houses. I love the fact that humans have had these other animals taking advantage of the ecosystems that we create basically since we started living settled life. Every location that has humans has their \u201crat.\u201d Sometimes that\u2019s a rat, and sometimes it\u2019s a pigeon or a cockatoo or a lizard or a horse. It\u2019s not about what these animals are doing. Animals live in ecosystems that we create, and we hate animals that live too close."},
{"text": " The reflexiveness of people\u2019s responses [to pests]. People respond emotionally. When you make them pause and think about it, they go, \u201cOh wow, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. I should not be caught trying to kill a raccoon with a sword.\u201d But in the moment, you\u2019re so wrapped up in the violation of what you see as your personal space."},
{"text": "The other thing is the extent to which our disdain of pests is wrapped up in social justice. A lot of times we see this hatred and disgust for animals that we see as \u201clow class.\u201d High-class people don\u2019t have rats. And that\u2019s really about social justice, about infrastructure and the ability of people to live in clean houses, store their food properly or even have a house at all."},
{"text": "Also, the way we deal with these animals often has vestiges of colonialism, as in the chapter on elephants. [In Kenya, European colonists] made people grow corn and sugarcane, which elephants love. Colonization created national park systems that assumed that humans had no place in wilderness, shoving out Indigenous pastoralists. Colonization created the market for poached ivory. And colonizing people assumed that Indigenous people did not like elephants or know their benefits. We are living with the consequences. Many modern efforts at elephant protection are spearheaded by Western people, and they assume the biggest issue with elephants is poaching and that Indigenous people don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for themselves or the elephants. In fact, human-elephant conflict [which includes elephant crop raids] is the far bigger problem, and Indigenous people have a long history of coexisting with elephants."},
{"text": " It\u2019s important to realize there\u2019s more than one way to look at the world. By learning from other cultures, it helps us understand our biases. It\u2019s only when you get outside of your own beliefs that you realize that\u2019s not just the way things are."},
{"text": " That\u2019s the result of context. And you see that in Western cultures all the time. People love squirrels. Well, they\u2019re basically rats with better PR. Then you have people who have pet rats, who would probably scream if a sewer rat ran by."},
{"text": " No. The animal that I\u2019ve probably come away with the most negative impression of is humans. It\u2019s funny because we think we can extinct anything. And I love how these animals have gone: \u201cOh, poison? That\u2019s cute.\u201d \u201cOh, a trap? You\u2019re funny.\u201d We\u2019ve tried to use electric fences on elephants [to stop them from eating crops]. And elephants are like, \u201cGuess what? Ivory doesn\u2019t conduct electricity.\u201d Even if they don\u2019t have tusks, elephants just pick up a log [to destroy the fence]."},
{"text": " I hope that they will ask why they respond to pests the way they do. Instead of just going, \u201cThis animal bothers me,\u201d ask why, and does it make sense. I also hope it opens more curiosity about the animals around us. I learned from Indigenous groups just how much knowledge they have of the animals in their ecosystem. I hope more people learn.

{"text": "Some data gaps originated early in the pandemic. For instance, in spring 2020, people who lacked a travel history to China or didn\u2019t have typical flulike symptoms were unable to get a PCR test to confirm they were infected. So when some of those people later developed long COVID, their initial illness had not been logged in medical records \u2014 making it difficult for them to get care and keeping them off most researchers\u2019 radar."},
{"text": "Other data gaps reveal long-standing problems in how the medical system treats complex, chronic diseases. Doctors weren\u2019t looking out for long-term symptoms, despite warnings from experts in other postviral diseases. And some of the most common long COVID symptoms, such as a dramatic worsening of health after exertion, lack a standard code for documentation in medical charts, making them hard to track."},
{"text": "Filling in those gaps is becoming increasingly crucial. Studies suggest that between 10 and 30 percent of people with COVID-19 may experience long-term symptoms, ranging from a simple loss of smell and taste to debilitating cognitive challenges. In the United States alone, that adds up to millions of people who, long after the pandemic ends, may still be dealing with the consequences of the disease."},

{"text": ", a group of long COVID patients who also have research experience."},
{"text": "What\u2019s more, records \u201cdo not document all of the symptoms the patient experiences,\u201d she says. And for many patients, information about different symptoms can be spread across different healthcare systems, making it difficult for researchers to connect the dots."},
{"text": "\u201cA long COVID diagnosis can mean so many different things in your physiology are going wrong,\u201d says David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai healthcare system in New York City and leader of one of the first labs to focus on long COVID. More comprehensive tracking of patients\u2019 symptoms, he says, is crucial to better understand how long COVID presents itself and document how it impacts patients\u2019 lives."},
{"text": "To achieve this goal, experts say, future data collection must be designed collaboratively. Coordination between patients and researchers helps ensure studies are asking the right questions, while coordination between experts with different specialties promotes multidisciplinary, creative approaches to a condition that impacts every organ system in the body. Coordination between research groups in different locations is also important for producing inclusive datasets."},
{"text": "New studies currently in early phases across the United States provide models for how scientists can work with patients and across specialties to investigate long COVID, learning from mistakes made earlier in the pandemic. The results of this work could inform strategies for patients to manage their symptoms and lead to potential treatments."},

{"text": "."},
{"text": "\u201cPatients know the right questions to ask to properly document their experience,\u201d McCorkell says. This can include which symptoms are studied, how data are collected from patients and how groups of patients are compared."},
{"text": "For example, one common flaw in research design is that potential long COVID patients might be included in a study\u2019s control group (that is, with the assumption that they do not have the condition) because they lack a positive test result or \u201cdo not have the exact symptoms a study defines as being long COVID,\u201d McCorkell explains. Since many long COVID patients \u2014 especially those who got sick early in the pandemic \u2014 lack positive test results, such a control group can skew study findings because researchers are comparing two groups of people that, potentially, both include patients with long COVID."},

{"text": "Surveys have become a particularly valuable tool in long COVID research, filling the gaps left by electronic health records. Health records are \u201cthe clunkiest part of this research,\u201d says Arjun Venkatesh, a patient-reported outcomes researcher at Yale University who is investigating "},
{"text": ". While new web applications and "},

{"text": "Venkatesh and his colleagues use surveys to collect basic information, such as a patient\u2019s vaccine record, as well as metrics that typically wouldn\u2019t be in an electronic health record, such as their fatigue levels over time. In setting up these surveys, it\u2019s important to solicit input from patients, Venkatesh and others say. Filling out a survey could trigger common long COVID symptoms like brain fog or post-exertion pain and fatigue. Responsible researchers ask a small group of patient volunteers to test surveys before they are widely released."},
{"text": "Input from patients is also crucial in designing clinical trials for long COVID, says Julia Moore Vogel, a program director at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. People living with the condition have spent time reading studies, comparing notes and testing out symptom management techniques. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a decent amount of anecdotal data we can use to inform trials,\u201d she says."},
{"text": "Anecdotal data inspired a study that Vogel, a long-hauler herself, is starting. She is aiming to enroll 5,000 patients who will test how well a wearable device helps them manage their symptoms, using a technique called pacing. Some Garmin health trackers have a feature called \u201cbody battery,\u201d which combines several measurements to determine the user\u2019s capacity for exertion. Vogel and other long-haulers use this feature to monitor their activity, stopping to rest when their \u201cbattery\u201d gets low. Her new study aims to test the strategy on a larger scale."},

{"text": ". These conditions have historically received limited research funding even though they impact millions of people \u2014 a problem attributed in part to the diseases\u2019 inability to fit into a specific medical specialty, says Jaime Seltzer, director of scientific and medical outreach at the ME/CFS advocacy group #MEAction, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif."},
{"text": "Funding from the National Institutes of Health, for example, is allocated to research groups through the agency\u2019s topic-focused institutes and centers. \u201cEvery disease is supposed to neatly and nicely fit into these categories,\u201d Seltzer says. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t, everyone goes, \u2018It\u2019s not my problem.\u2019\u201d Conditions like ME/CFS and long COVID also are not taught in medical schools, leading to a general lack of awareness among doctors about how to properly diagnose them, she says, which results in incomplete datasets."},
{"text": "To push back against this fractured system, doctors and researchers need to collaborate across specialties, experts say.

{"text": "During a colonoscopy, a physician looks for and removes polyps, growths of tissue that can become cancerous. But the procedure\u2019s expense, time and preparation can be prohibitive for some patients, says Carol Burke, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. People may not have the flexibility to take time off work for the procedure or have someone who is available to drive them home, for example. To complete a colonoscopy, \u201cyou have to be sure that you can address the patient\u2019s barriers,\u201d Burke says."},

{"text": "Another limitation of the new study has to do with time. Colon cancer develops slowly. Most polyps don\u2019t become cancerous, but for those that do, it can take 10 years or more. Then it takes time for the cancer to spread and become fatal. At least 15 years of follow up are needed to really look at the impact on colorectal cancer deaths, Shaukat says, so the study\u2019s report at 10 years isn\u2019t long enough."},
{"text": "And the quality of the colonoscopies performed in the study varied. One standard is the adenoma detection rate, the number of colonoscopies that turn up a precancerous polyp, or adenoma, divided by the number of colonoscopies performed over a period of time. In the new study, nearly 30 percent of the physicians doing the procedures had rates below the recommended minimum quality rate."},
{"text": "In their paper, the study\u2019s authors acknowledge these limitations. They note that the colonoscopy-by-invitation approach may have underestimated the benefits of the procedure.

And, they add, differences in quality benchmarks among practitioners may have affected the detection of cancer."},

With his adviser, developmental biologist Marianne Bronner, he identified transcription factors \u2014 proteins that can turn genes on and off \u2014 that were present only in cranial cells. Transplanting the genes for those proteins into trunk cells endowed the cells with the ability to create cartilage and bone."},

His team reconstructed how neural crest cells\u2019 full set of genetic instructions, or the genome, folds into a compact, 3-D shape. The researchers identified short DNA sequences, called enhancers, that are located in faraway regions of the genome, but end up close to key genes when the genome folds. These enhancers work with transcription factors and other regulatory elements to control gene activity."},
{"text": "Sim\u00f5es-Costa is also using neural crest cells to elucidate a strange behavior shared by cancer cells and some embryonic cells. These cells produce energy anaerobically, without oxygen, even when oxygen is present. Called the Warburg effect, this metabolic process has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its function remained unclear."},
{"text": "Through experiments manipulating the metabolism of neural crest cells, Sim\u00f5es-Costa\u2019s team found that the Warburg effect is necessary for the cells to move around during early development. The mechanism, which should stay turned off in nonembryonic cells, somehow \u201cgets reactivated in adult cells in the context of cancer, leading those cells to become more migratory and more invasive,\u201d Sim\u00f5es-Costa says."},

{"text": "How does the genetic blueprint tell cells where they are in the embryo, and what they should be doing? How do cancer cells hijack the Warburg effect, and could understanding of that process lead to new treatments? These are some of the questions Sim\u00f5es-Costa wants to tackle next."},

They also obscure the immense variation that exists, even on a single person\u2019s head, and especially among curly hair."},

As researchers try to understand long COVID, and how to treat it, they will need to differentiate between these different flavors, called endotypes, Putrino says. Different flavors will call for different treatments. Something like an antiviral will probably work only for those people whose long COVID symptoms are caused by viral persistence. A blood thinner wouldn\u2019t work for them but could help those with microclots."},

That quickly changed when Putrino, unprompted, described a class of people who just can\u2019t get back to working out, or need an extra cup of coffee to keep up with their pre-COVID pace. This described how I have felt for months to a tee.

{"text": "Through such adventures, Cooke learns that females are anything but boring. \u201cFemale animals are just as promiscuous, competitive, aggressive, dominant and dynamic as males,\u201d she writes."},
{"text": "That may not sound radical to today\u2019s feminists, but in the field of evolutionary biology, such a pronouncement has long bordered on the heretical. Generations of biologists have focused on male behavior and physiology, on the assumption that females are little more than baby-making machines to be won over by the strongest, showiest males."},
{"text": "Historically, when females did something potentially interesting, like exercise leadership over their social groups, many scientists scratched their heads and chalked it up as an aberration. When behavior didn\u2019t fit the mold, like female-dominant spotted hyenas or peaceable male pinyon jays, it was either ignored or shoehorned into existing theory. For instance, ornithologists posited that aggressive female pinyon jays must suffer \u201cthe avian equivalent of PMS,\u201d Cooke writes. The reality is that pinyon jays have a complex social hierarchy that doesn\u2019t include the \u201calpha male\u201d that scientists had expected. In recent years, scientists (many, but not all of them, female themselves) have begun to challenge Darwinian dogma about the sexes and submit it to rigorous testing."},
{"text": "Cooke draws on this recent science to systematically take down myths about females. She begins by asking what biological sex actually is \u2014 what makes a male a male, and a female a female \u2014 and shows that it\u2019s far less black-and-white than we\u2019ve been led to believe. Take the case of the European mole, in which the female sports gonads called ovotestes that produce eggs during the short breeding season, and testosterone the rest of the time. As a result, the female\u2019s genitalia look just like the male\u2019s, with a penislike clitoris and a vagina that vanishes after the breeding season."},
{"text": "The mole is just one example of sexual ambiguity among many that Cooke outlines. As the science of recent decades has revealed, even the genetics of sex is far more complicated than having either XX or XY chromosomes (which themselves are just one of many genetic systems for determining sex across the animal kingdom). In humans, males and females have the same set of about 60 sex-determining genes, which can create either testes or ovaries. Because of shared biology, the sexes are far more alike than they are different, and they exist in more of a continuum of bodies and behaviors than many people may be comfortable with."},
{"text": "Cooke also takes on many other ways scientists have misread sexual dynamics over the years, such as the myth that males benefit evolutionarily from promiscuity and females from monogamy. She addresses misconceptions about sexual cannibalism and animal genitals, complete with silicone replicas of animal vaginas. And she challenges ideas about the maternal instinct. As Cooke points out, males and females share the same neural circuitry, leading to fascinating experiments that stimulate certain nerve cells to flip male mice from infanticidal to doting dads."},
{"text": "In short, Cooke demolishes much of what you probably learned about the sexes in biology class. This may be disconcerting, even confronting for those who feel comfortable in the warm embrace of Darwinian order. But it\u2019s also exciting, and fascinating, and very well might change the way you see the world. "},

At the start of the pandemic, most experts predicted that coronavirus infections and asthma would be a dangerous mix, says Luke Bonser, a cell biologist at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved in the study. And that is true for people whose asthma is not triggered by allergies and those with related lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Those conditions put people at high risk for severe COVID-19."},
{"text": "But as the pandemic progressed, researchers noticed that people with allergic asthma weren\u2019t developing severe COVID-19 as often as expected. Here\u2019s a look at why that may be."},
{"text": "What sets allergic asthma apart from other types of asthma and COPD is a protein called interleukin-13, or IL-13."},
{"text": "Usually, IL-13 helps the body fight off parasites such as worms. Certain T cells pump out the protein, and the body responds by churning out sticky mucus and constricting airways. This traps the worms, holding them in place until other immune system cells can come in for the kill."},
{"text": "\u201cIn the case of [allergic] asthma, the body is making a mistake. It\u2019s mistaking a harmless substance, like pollen, for a worm,\u201d says Burton Dickey, a pulmonologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who was not involved in the study. \u00a0"},
{"text": "But it wasn\u2019t clear how IL-13 was protecting people with allergic asthma from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To find out, pathophysiologist Camille Ehre of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and colleagues grew cells from the lining of the airways from six lung donors. Some of the cells were treated with IL-13 to mimic allergic asthma. Then the researchers infected some of the cells with SARS-CoV-2."},
{"text": "Next on the list of to-dos was to compare how cells that haven\u2019t been treated with IL-13 behave when healthy and when infected with the coronavirus."},
{"text": "Uninfected cells grew in lawns resembling lush grasslands, where the tufts of waving fronds are actually hairlike protrusions called cilia, which grow from the tops of airway-lining cells, the team confirmed. Cilia\u2019s motions help move mucus, and anything stuck in the mucus, out of the lungs."},
{"text": "Cells infected with the coronavirus looked much different. The lush lawn was now slathered in mucus, and bald spots appeared as infected cells died. The doomed cells get squeezed out of the lawn of cilia and inflate like a balloon. The inflation happens partly because chambers called vacuoles inside the infected cells get clogged with viruses. \u201cIt\u2019s just filled with viruses, and then it gets kicked out of the club and it blows up and releases all these viruses,\u201d Dickey says."},
{"text": "But not all the cells in the infected lawn were affected equally. Looking at the cells from the side, researchers could see that cells sporting cilia were infected with the coronavirus. But mucus-producing cells called goblet cells, which don\u2019t have cilia, were rarely infected. That may be because a protein called ACE2 decorates the surface of ciliated cells far more often than it does goblet cells. ACE2 is the protein that the coronavirus uses as a door into cells."},
{"text": "When researchers doused the cells with IL-13 before adding the coronavirus, the results were strikingly different."},
{"text": "The lawn of waving cilia atop the treated cells was mostly intact, with far fewer balloons of dying cells rising above the surface. But the fronds didn\u2019t wave as vigorously as in untreated cells. That\u2019s because IL-13 reduces cilia beating, the researchers found. \u00a0Less active cilia could mean that virus-laden mucus sticks around longer. \u201cThat can be a double-edged sword inside the lungs because you want to clear the mucus, but you don\u2019t want to spread it around,\u201d Ehre says."},
{"text": "Counting cells under the microscope, the researchers saw that far fewer of the infected cells treated with IL-13 got the heave-ho. Whereas the untreated cells had ejected about 700 of their own by about four days after infection, only about 100 treated cells had gotten kicked out. The images showed that IL-13 really was protecting cells from infection. But how was still an unanswered question."},
{"text": "One thing that IL-13 does is stimulate airway-lining cells to churn out a type of sticky mucus that can trap viruses before they can infect cells. The team found that untreated cells released a burst of the mucus shortly after being infected with the coronavirus, depleting stores of the sticky stuff. But cells treated with IL-13 were still well-stocked with mucus."},
{"text": "All that extra mucus from the treated cells could ensnare viruses and expel them from the lungs before much damage is done. But people with nonallergic asthma and COPD make plenty of mucus too, and they aren\u2019t protected from the virus. So Ehre and colleagues stripped away the mucus to see how the airway cells fared without this phlegmy trap."},
{"text": "Even without the mucus, IL-13 was still protective."},
{"text": "Examining patterns of gene activity, the team found that IL-13 was also causing cells to make less ACE2, the protein that SARS-CoV-2 commandeers as a gateway into cells. \u201cIt makes it much harder for the virus to find its door to enter the cells,\u201d Ehre says."},
{"text": "That result agrees with previous findings from Bonser and colleagues. \u201cBeing able to replicate the same data in several different studies, that\u2019s great,\u201d he says. And the new study looks more closely into IL-13\u2019s protective mechanism than previous research did."},
{"text": "Cells treated with IL-13 also turn down the activity of genes involved in making protein-producing factories called ribosomes, the researchers discovered. That may limit viral replication in cells. But some genes\u2019 activity was also turned way up. That includes several genes involved in making keratan sulfate, a long chain of sugars that is found in cartilage and the eyes\u2019 corneas. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the body to make a shield,\u201d Ehre says."},
{"text": "That seems to be what it is doing for airway cells too. A thick layer of keratan sulfate developed on top of cells treated with IL-13, armoring them against a coronavirus infection."},
{"text": "Which of these protective mechanisms is most important, or if it\u2019s a combination of all of them, is one of the many things left to explore, Ehre says. \u201cThis paper is not the final paper that figures everything out. There is way more work to do.\u201d"},
{"text": "Knowing even more details about how IL-13 works to protect against the coronavirus could lead to new treatments, Bonser says. But IL-13 itself probably will not be used as a drug because of the inflammation, excess mucus, cough and shortness of breath it triggers."},
{"text": "Unfortunately, the extra protection doesn\u2019t mean that people with allergic asthma don\u2019t have to be concerned about getting COVID-19, Dickey says. \u201cPeople with asthma have had very bad outcomes. This is not a virus you want to take chances with,\u201d he says.

Rather than viewing the insect crisis as all insect populations on one downward-trending line on a graph, Milman suggests picturing lots of different lines \u2014 some holding steady, some sloping up or down, and some zigzagging. \u201cInsects are being shifted to an unhappy state where there will be far more bedbugs and mosquitoes and far fewer bumblebees and monarch butterflies,\u201d he writes."},

Another researcher recalls the joy of catching fireflies on his family ranch in Texas as a child. I felt a wave of sadness as I thought about how I don\u2019t see fireflies as much as I did when I was a kid.

Milman also offers hope, sharing how certain insects are adapting to the threats and how some people are fighting to protect the critters through political campaigns and changing farming habits."},

{"text": "The three credited inventors \u2014 William Shockley, John Bardeen and William Brattain \u2014 had found a way to create a very fast switch or amplifier by running a current through a slightly impure slice of germanium.

But because the pandemic is a time warp, I decided to catch up with Gordon now to see if her thinking has changed since February 2021. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity."},
{"text": "One of the things that we\u2019ve learned about reinfection or [vaccine] breakthroughs is that once people have that second exposure \u2014 be that their first is vaccination and their second is infection or their first is infection and second is vaccination \u2014 people generate \u201chybrid immunity.\u201d People are generating a broader [immune] response which is going to help protect them against future infections. It\u2019s not going to be sterilizing immunity against all variants that arise, but it\u2019s certainly going to help reduce the probability that people get infected or reinfected with every variant. And when they do get reinfected, they will be more mild infections."},

They would help to reduce severity for people who do have breakthrough infections. I think it\u2019s generally felt that there\u2019s a need for an omicron-specific booster because getting vaccinated and boosted with the original strain of the virus is not very effective at preventing infections with omicron."},
{"text": "We need to look toward the future. I think one of the big questions with an omicron-specific booster is going to be what effect will that booster have on somebody who\u2019s already been vaccinated or even vaccinated and boosted previously. Is it just boosting immunity to omicron? Or do you see them develop broader immunity? Through boosting with a different variant, you might generate broader immunity to protect not only against omicron but also briefly protect against any future variants that circulate."},
{"text": "I think completely letting go of control at this point would be a mistake. We\u2019re not through it, we\u2019re not at the endemic level [when the virus normally circulates at some baseline amount]. But I do think we are in a transition period."},
{"text": "If you look back at flu pandemics, for example, there has been a transition period: The first year or two with a very heavy toll, but then beyond that, [transmission] typically stays higher for a few years. I think at this point, we\u2019re in a stage where most countries \u2014 not every single country but in most \u2014 a majority of the population has some level of immunity. What the transition period looks like for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, really depends on the severity of infections and how many exposures do we need to get down to whatever an endemic level is. Certainly, one exposure seems to have really reduced severity, but maybe that didn\u2019t get it down to the endemic level where you\u2019ve grown up being exposed to this virus your entire life. The length of that transition period and how painful it is, is really going to depend on the severity of reinfections that occur over time."},
{"text": "Endemic is a period where the virus has hit a \u201cnormal level.\u201d You\u2019ve got a high level of population immunity, and [the virus] still causes some specific level of severe disease. We don\u2019t know what that looks like yet. We don\u2019t know if, in the endemic phase, the severity of this virus is going to look like a seasonal coronavirus [that causes a cold] or if it\u2019s going to look more like the severity of influenza [which can kill tens of thousands of people on average per year in the United States] or more severe than influenza. We actually need to get to where it\u2019s at an endemic level before we know all of that."},
{"text": "And the other thing is the rates of infection. We know for seasonal coronaviruses that people get reinfected really often \u2014 on average probably about every three years but it can happen as soon as six months after, even in people who\u2019ve been exposed to it throughout their entire lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, the entire population was na\u00efve to this new coronavirus. We\u2019ve been building immunity over time, so transmission stays quite high. That\u2019s going to slow down as people build up immunity, but we\u2019ll see. We may have a need for annual boosters or regular boosters. We might be able to come up with a more broadly protective vaccine that lasts for longer \u2014 that would be fantastic."},

{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). Various experiments suggested properties of the atom that seemed irreconcilable. But Bohr forged those experimental clues into a \u201cmaster hypothesis\u201d that produced a thoroughly novel understanding of the atom and its structure."},
{"text": "Perovi\u0107 describes how Bohr\u2019s process began with lower-level hypotheses stemming from features directly given by experiment. Spectral lines \u2014 different specific colors of light emitted by atoms \u2014 led to basic hypotheses that some vibratory process, of an atom itself or its constituents, produced electromagnetic radiation exhibiting precise patterns. Intermediate hypotheses about the structure of the atom did not explain such lines, though. And then Ernest Rutherford, on the basis of experiments in his lab, inferred that an atom was mostly empty space. It contained a dense, tiny central nucleus encompassing most of the mass, while lightweight electrons orbited at a distance. But that hypothesis didn\u2019t mesh with the precise patterns of spectral lines. And such an atom would be unstable, persisting for less than a millisecond. From all these disparate experiment-based hypotheses, Bohr applied Planck\u2019s quantum idea to construct a master hypothesis. He reconciled the spectral lines and Rutherford\u2019s nuclear atom with a new atomic model, in which electrons maintained stability of the atom but jumped from one orbit to another, emitting specific patterns of spectral lines in the process."},
{"text": "As Perovi\u0107 demonstrates, Bohr followed a similar course in arriving at complementarity. While numerous experiments showed that light was a wave, by the early 1920s other experiments established that X-rays, highly energetic light, collided with electrons just as though both were particles (momentum and energy were conserved in the collisions just as the particle view required). Bohr\u2019s master hypothesis, complementarity, seemed the only way forward."},
{"text": "Throughout the book, Perovi\u0107 relates how Bohr has been misinterpreted, his views misleadingly conflated with those of others (like John von Neumann and Werner Heisenberg), and his philosophy incorrectly portrayed as antirealist \u2014 suggesting that only observations brought reality into existence. Bohr never said any such thing, and in fact cautioned against using language so loosely."},
{"text": "Perovi\u0107\u2019s account offers a thorough survey of other historical investigations into Bohr\u2019s work and draws liberally from Bohr\u2019s own writings. It\u2019s a nuanced and insightful presentation of the interplay of experiment and theory in the scientific process. This book is not easy reading, though. It\u2019s not the place to seek clear explanations of quantum physics and Bohr\u2019s interpretation of it. Perovi\u0107 opts for scholarly thoroughness and careful reasoning with a propensity for long sentences. But then again, Bohr\u2019s writings were no breeze, either. In fact, a major complaint against Bohr has been expressed by authors who say his writings are very difficult to understand. It\u2019s unfortunate that so many seem to think that because they can\u2019t understand Bohr, he must have been wrong. Perovi\u0107\u2019s book provides a useful antidote to that attitude. "},

{"text": "Raff delves into several competing models of how, when and where people first made inroads into the Americas. One approach holds that Ice Age Siberians, known from archaeological finds, reached North America between 16,000 and 14,000 years ago and, within a few millennia, journeyed south across the continent through a gap in the melting ice sheet. Those settlers probably founded "},

{"text": "Fortunately, omicron seems less likely than previous versions of the coronavirus to cause deep lung infections that lead to serious complications, such as admissions to intensive care units, intubation and death. But the surge of cases means that vulnerable people, including the unvaccinated, immunocompromised, elderly and those with underlying health conditions, are still landing in hospital beds."},
{"text": "\u201cHealth care systems are really under stress,\u201d Malani says."},
{"text": "The key to heading off collapse of health care systems is to prevent people from needing to visit emergency rooms and be admitted to the hospital in the first place. Testing and isolation of infected people has helped to stem the tide of previous waves of infection, but omicron is spreading quickly and tests of all kinds are in short supply. And as quick as rapid tests are, they may not catch someone with omicron before they become infectious. What\u2019s more, some treatments, such as laboratory-made monoclonal antibodies, aren\u2019t as effective against omicron as they were against other variants. Other treatments, including new antiviral pills, are scarce."},
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a rough couple weeks for sure, and maybe longer,\u201d Malani says."},
{"text": "Here\u2019s a look at some of the challenges that omicron presents for testing and treatment."},
{"text": "Daily PCR testing and rapid antigen tests have helped many employers nip outbreaks in the bud by identifying infected employees and isolating them before they could pass the virus on to others, says Blythe Adamson, an infectious disease epidemiologist and economist. She founded Infectious Economics, a New York City\u2013based company that helps businesses devise strategies to limit disease spread in workplaces."},
{"text": "But omicron has hampered those efforts. In a study conducted in December during the ongoing omicron surge, Adamson and colleagues tested people at five workplaces in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco with PCR tests that gave answers within eight hours. \u201cThis population was 100 percent vaccinated.\u2026 And they were highly boosted, so they were doing all the right things,\u201d Adamson says. Yet employees were still getting infected and spreading the virus."},
{"text": "At the workplaces, \u201comicron outbreaks looked really different than delta outbreaks were looking before,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile daily PCR testing previous to omicron worked really well to pick up cases before they were infectious, we started noticing [with omicron] that people were slipping through the cracks. Transmissions were happening faster. People were becoming infectious faster and spreading it to other people.\u201d"},
{"text": "So rapid antigen tests were added to the mix. Even after finding a positive test, the researchers continued testing the employees daily, adding an unprecedented look at COVID-19 infections in the early stages and allowing the researchers to determine whether rapid antigen tests are still good for pinpointing when people with COVID-19 are infectious to others."},

{"text": "). But new evidence from Adamson\u2019s group and a study conducted at a walk-up test site in San Francisco calls that past stellar performance into question. \u201cI\u2019m no longer confident that that negative is as meaningful as it was two weeks ago,\u201d says Bob Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco."},
{"text": "The trouble seems to be at the front end of an infection."},

{"text": "One of the characteristics emerging about omicron specifically is where it lives in the body. Compared with previous variants, omicron seems to be more abundant in some upper respiratory areas, such as the throat, than in the nose, at least in the early days of an infection. That locale means that a nose swab may be missing omicron early on, before viral levels are high."},
{"text": "Adamson\u2019s group found that in the first two days of infection, saliva swabs were better than nasal swabs at picking up infectious cases. By day three, particularly if people had symptoms, there was no difference in the ability of rapid antigen tests to detect the infection, regardless if the swab came from saliva or the nose, Adamson says.

{"text": "The problem now comes if you test negative on a rapid antigen test. With omicron, you can no longer be sure you\u2019re not infectious, Adamson says. \u201cYou would not want to right now with omicron have a 300-person wedding where you test everyone with a rapid antigen. With the prevalence of omicron in the community, you would absolutely have a superspreading event.\u201d"},
{"text": "Just as with previous versions of the virus, most people who are sick with omicron will recover on their own at home with standard hunker-down advice: Rest, fluids and fever-reducing medicine. But some people need more medical help, and omicron has changed that process. With omicron cases flooding hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, treatments are essential to prevent serious disease."},
{"text": "At first glance, help is at hand. In late December, two new oral pills were authorized by the FDA: molnupiravir from Merck and Paxlovid made by Pfizer. Both drugs and the antiviral drug remdesivir were designed to stop coronaviruses from copying themselves in the body. All three seem to "},
{"text": " in lab tests, researchers reported in a preprint posted December 28 at bioRxiv.org, but there are no data yet to suggest how the drugs work in the real world, especially against the fast-moving variant."},
{"text": "Molnupiravir drops a person\u2019s risk of "},
{"text": " ("},

That makes it an especially risky choice for women who are pregnant or might become pregnant, says Katherine Seley-Radtke, a medicinal chemist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Lab animal studies have shown that high doses or prolonged use of the drug may cause genetic mutations or developmental problems in fetuses. There have been no long-term studies of molnupiravir\u2019s effect on people."},
{"text": "Other antivirals have their own issues. Remdesivir is approved for use in hospitalized people, but recent evidence has suggested it can "},
{"text": " too, researchers reported December 22 in the "},
{"text": ". Remdesivir blocks viral replication by inserting a dummy RNA building block that stops RNA copying. The problem with that drug is that it must be given intravenously, though its maker, Gilead Sciences, is reportedly working on pill and inhaled forms of remdesivir."},
{"text": "Remdesivir has another drawback in that it has to be converted in the body to its active form. That works better for some people than others, and can affect how well the drug can keep the coronavirus in check, Seley-Radtke says."},
{"text": "For some people, the best choice for treatment may be Pfizer\u2019s new antiviral pill. In clinical trials, Paxlovid, a combination medication which blocks a protein-cutting enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate itself, "},
{"text": " in high-risk people by 88 percent. It does not have the mutation concerns associated with molnupiravir, but it might introduce problems when given to people taking other drugs."},
{"text": "That\u2019s because Paxlovid also contains a drug called ritonavir. Ritonavir blocks the action of enzymes that break down drugs, keeping levels of the virus inhibitor in the body high so that it can fight the virus. But those enzymes that ritonavir inhibits also process other drugs, so people might accidentally overdose on their other medications. Doctors and pharmacists need to keep a close eye out for such drug interactions when prescribing Paxlovid to patients, Seley-Radtke says."},
{"text": "There is a bigger hurdle for Paxlovid, though. There isn\u2019t enough of it to go around, especially as hospitalizations surge. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic situation of scarcity,\u201d Wachter says. At UCSF, \u201cwe have a fair amount of the Merck drug. We have very little of Paxlovid,\u201d he says."},
{"text": "\u201cIf I have a choice, the Pfizer drug seems like it\u2019s better in every regard, better efficacy and easier to take,\u201d Wachter says. \u201cBut for now, we are highly rationing it.\u201d Many of the people who need the treatment the most are unvaccinated \u2013 a situation that \u201craises a whole bunch of moral questions, that they would jump ahead of the line of someone who made a better choice,\u201d Wachter says. This rationing framework is \u201ca hard thing to get your arms around, but not inconsistent with the way we do the rest of medicine,\u201d hehe says. \u201cWe don\u2019t treat a lung cancer patient differently depending on whether they smoked.\u201d"},
{"text": "Another hurdle for the antiviral drugs is that they work best if given very early in the infection, ideally within three days of symptoms starting. But omicron replicates faster than delta or other previous versions of the virus, perhaps making the window for treatment even shorter, Seley-Radtke says."},
{"text": "It\u2019s unclear what that accelerated timeline means for another class of treatments, monoclonal antibodies. Omicron\u2019s highly mutated spike protein is missing many of the targets that some "},
{"text": ". Two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments that have been authorized for use in the United States seem to falter with omicron. Of the three, only one, called sotrovimab, seems to incapacitate omicron\u2019s spike protein.

In his view, feelings have played a central role in the life-regulating processes of animals throughout the history of life."},

{"text": ", Damasio suggests that consciousness evolved as a way to keep essential bodily systems steady.

Once we access feeling, we can then get a mental picture of how the state of life really is in our organism. So, we can get a warning that things are going wrong, and we get suffering. Or, we get a signal that things are reasonably OK, and we can afford to do other things, which is what happens with positive feelings. So I can afford to have this conversation with you because I\u2019m not having a fever; I\u2019m not terribly thirsty, hungry, or I\u2019m not in pain."},
{"text": "Feelings are representations of the state of your body. To have a feeling of pain, pleasure, well-being, sickness, thirst, hunger or desire is to generate a picture of some parts of your organs. For example, the feeling of well-being is related to parameters that you can locate and measure. This is something that we can analyze; we can actually study it in the laboratory. A lot of what would be described as [the feeling of] well-being is related to the simple musculature that is around blood vessels in organs, like the stomach, the gut and so forth. And even muscular skeletal components of our body, how they are: Are they contracted? Are they distended, a large part, or not so much? What we are feeling from well-being is, in fact, describing states of our body; that\u2019s what feelings are about. So the root of feeling in the state of the organism is unquestionable."},

Because of their round robin copycatting, PCR tests are very sensitive and can pick up small amounts of viral RNA, including before a person becomes contagious.

Health experts advise waiting five to seven days after exposure to take a test, but people are often testing positive within three to five days with the delta variant, she says. It\u2019s unknown how long it might take to get a positive result if infected with the omicron variant."},
{"text": "At first glance, it seems logical that a vaccine might give wonky test results. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s DNA vaccine all contain instructions for building the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein. A PCR test might pick up on that signal, right?"},
{"text": "It turns out that many PCR tests probe for multiple viral genes, including ones encoding the spike and N proteins, \u00a0but also for an RNA polymerase that copies the virus\u2019s genetic material and for the virus\u2019s envelope, or E protein. A test is positive if it picks up on all of its target markers. But a signal from the vaccines\u2019 spike protein alone isn\u2019t enough to send up a red flag. Also the mRNA in the vaccines doesn\u2019t stick around for long in the body, 24 to 72 hours. So the vaccines do not interfere with accurate PCR test results."},
{"text": "Most of the antigen tests detect the N protein, not the spike protein.

That\u2019s generally not a problem since those tests are looking for multiple viral genes. In fact, the missing spike signal may be a clue that a person is infected with omicron rather than delta and that their sample should be examined more closely. Alpha and some other variants also caused S gene dropout, so it\u2019s not a slam dunk that the missing spike heralds an omicron infection.\u00a0\u00a0"},

International travelers will also probably need to get a PCR test for official verification that they are safe to fly, Gronvall says. \u201cYou could say that you\u2019re negative, but without proof they\u2019re not going to take your word for it.\u201d"},

He draws these tales from his own experiences and those of other scientists, combining reporting with narrative tales of species that serve as examples of broader trends in the natural world."},
{"text": "A trip to La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, for example, has Hanson reliving the experience of tropical ecologist and climatologist Leslie Holdridge, who founded the research station in the 1950s and described, among other things, how climate creates different habitats, or life zones, as elevation increases. As Hanson sweats his way up a tropical mountainside so he can witness a shift in life zones, he notes, \u201cI had to earn every foot of elevation gain the hard way.\u201d I could almost feel the heat that he describes as \u201ca steaming towel draped over my head.\u201d His vivid descriptions bring home the reason why so many species have now been documented moving upslope to cooler climes."},
{"text": "Hanson doesn\u2019t waste much breath trying to convince doubters of the reality of climate change, instead showing by example after example how it is already playing out. The book moves quickly from the basic science of climate change to the challenges and opportunities that species face \u2014 from shifts in seasonal timing to ocean acidification \u2014 and the ways that species are responding."},

But that pithy phrase doesn\u2019t capture the complexity of the situation. For instance, one of his titular characters, a lizard slammed by back-to-back Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, illustrates a different response. Instead of individual lizards adjusting, or adapting, to increasingly stormy conditions, the species evolved through natural selection. Biologists monitoring the lizards on two islands noticed that after the hurricanes, the lizard populations had longer front legs, shorter back legs and grippier toe pads on average than they had before. An experiment with a leaf blower showed that these traits help the lizards cling to branches better \u2014 survival of the fittest in action."},
{"text": "In the end, the outcomes for species will probably be as varied as their circumstances. Some organisms have already moved, adapted or died as a result of the warming, and many more will face challenges from changes that are yet to come. But Hanson hasn\u2019t given up hope. When it comes to preventing the worst-case scenarios, he quotes ecologist Gordon Orians, who is in the seventh decade of a career witnessing environmental change. When asked what a concerned citizen should do to combat climate change, he responded succinctly: \u201cEverything you can.\u201d And as Hanson points out, this is exactly how plants and animals are responding to climate change: by doing everything they can. The challenge feels overwhelming, and as a single concerned citizen, much feels out of my hands. Yet Hanson\u2019s words did inspire me to take a cue from the rest of the species on this warming world to do what I can."},

{"text": "Molnupiravir might also create mutations in human DNA, researchers say. The drug is a nucleoside analog \u2014 an artificial RNA building block that can mimic the bases cytosine and uracil.

Many scholars explain growing gaps between the haves and the have-nots as partly a by-product of living in dense, urban populations. The bigger the crowd, from this perspective, the more we need power brokers to run the show. Societies have scaled up for thousands of years, which has magnified the distance between the wealthy and those left wanting."},
{"text": "In "},
{"text": ", anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow challenge the assumption that bigger societies inevitably produce a range of inequalities. Using examples from past societies, the pair also rejects the popular idea that social evolution occurred in stages."},
{"text": "Such stages, according to conventional wisdom, began with humans living in small hunter-gatherer bands where everyone was on equal footing. Then an agricultural revolution about 12,000 years ago fueled population growth and the emergence of tribes, then chiefdoms and eventually bureaucratic states. Or perhaps murderous alpha males dominated ancient hunter-gatherer groups. If so, early states may have represented attempts to corral our selfish, violent natures."},
{"text": "Neither scenario makes sense to Graeber and Wengrow. Their research synthesis\u2009\u2014\u2009which extends for 526 pages\u2009\u2014\u2009paints a more hopeful picture of social life over the last 30,000 to 40,000 years. For most of that time, the authors argue, humans have tactically alternated between small and large social setups. Some social systems featured ruling elites, working stiffs and enslaved people. Others emphasized decentralized, collective decision making. Some were run by men, others by women. The big question\u2009\u2014\u2009one the authors can\u2019t yet answer\u2009\u2014\u2009is why, after tens of thousands of years of social flexibility, many people today can\u2019t conceive of how society might effectively be reorganized."},
{"text": "Hunter-gatherers have a long history of revamping social systems from one season to the next, the authors write. About a century ago, researchers observed that Indigenous populations in North America and elsewhere often operated in small, mobile groups for part of the year and crystallized into large, sedentary communities the rest of the year. For example, each winter, Canada\u2019s Northwest Coast Kwakiutl hunter-gatherers built wooden structures where nobles ruled over designated commoners and enslaved people, and held banquets called potlatch. In summers, aristocratic courts disbanded, and clans with less formal social ranks fished along the coast."},

The graves may hold individuals who were accorded special status, at least at times of the year when mobile groups formed large communities and built large structures, the authors speculate. Seasonal gatherings to conduct rituals and feasts probably occurred at the monumental sites. No signs of centralized power, such as palaces or storehouses, accompany those sites."},
{"text": "Social flexibility and experimentation, rather than a revolutionary shift, also characterized ancient transitions to agriculture, Graeber and Wengrow write. Middle Eastern village excavations now indicate that the domestication of cereals and other crops occurred in fits and starts from around 12,000 to 9,000 years ago. Ancient Fertile Crescent communities periodically gave farming a go while still hunting, foraging, fishing and trading. Early cultivators were in no rush to treat tracts of land as private property or to form political systems headed by kings, the authors conclude."},
{"text": "Even in "},
{"text": " ("},
{"text": "), absolute rule by monarchs did not exist. Collective decisions were made by district councils and citizen assemblies, archaeological evidence suggests. In contrast, authoritarian, violent political systems appeared in the region\u2019s mobile, nonagricultural populations at that time."},
{"text": "Early states formed in piecemeal fashion, the authors argue. These political systems incorporated one or more of three basic elements of domination: violent control of the masses by authorities, bureaucratic management of special knowledge and information, and public demonstrations of rulers\u2019 power and charisma. Egypt\u2019s early rulers more than 4,000 years ago fused violent coercion of their subjects with extensive bureaucratic controls over daily affairs. Classic Maya rulers in Central America 1,100 years ago or more relied on administrators to monitor cosmic events while grounding earthly power in violent control and alliances with other kings."},
{"text": "States can take many forms, though. Graeber and Wengrow point to Bronze Age Minoan society on Crete as an example of a political system run by priestesses who called on citizens to transcend individuality via ecstatic experiences that bound the population together."},
{"text": "What seems to have changed today is that basic social liberties have receded, the authors contend. The freedom to relocate to new kinds of communities, to disobey commands issued by others and to create new social systems or alternate between different ones has become a scarce commodity. Finding ways to reclaim that freedom is a major challenge."},
{"text": "These examples give just a taste of the geographic and historical ground covered by the authors. Shortly after finishing writing the book, Graeber, who died in 2020, tweeted: \u201cMy brain feels bruised with numb surprise.\u201d That sense of revelation animates this provocative take on humankind\u2019s social journey."},
