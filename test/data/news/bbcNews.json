{"text": "The Trump administration had adopted a strict border policy and the Biden White House promised a more \"humane\" approach."},
{"text": "Of the hundreds of immigration-focused actions the Biden White House has taken on the file, dozens have been aimed at reversing or undoing the policies of his predecessor. "},
{"text": "But the Democratic president has faced criticism both from immigration advocates who say his policies are unduly harsh and from Republican political foes who say he has not done enough. "},
{"text": "Here's how the two US presidents compare."},
{"text": "In March 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, a controversial statute ostensibly meant as a public health measure. "},
{"text": "The policy allowed US authorities to swiftly expel migrants - including asylum seekers - at the border. "},
{"text": "Nearly 400,000 people were detained and expelled between its implementation and January 2021, when Trump left the White House. "},
{"text": "Even at the height of the pandemic, Title 42 came under frequent criticism from those who argued the policy allowed the US to expel asylum seekers without any legal process. "},
{"text": "Human Rights Watch, for example, said the policy was \"illegal and violates the human rights of those subjected to it\". "},
{"text": "He defended keeping Title 42 in place, using the pandemic as justification. "},
{"text": "Over two million people were expelled using Title 42 authority between January 2021 and 11 May 2023, when it, alongside the declared US coronavirus public health emergency, expired. "},
{"text": "To replace it, US immigration authorities unveiled a \"carrot and stick\" approach that encourages legal pathways, while also implementing strict penalties for those who cross illegally.\u00a0"},
{"text": "The strategy included opening regional processing centres in Latin America to help migrants apply to come to the US, and expanded access to CBP One, an app for migrants to schedule asylum appointments."},
{"text": "A new, and long-awaited executive order on immigration unveiled on 4 June will also allow US authorities to swiftly deport migrants who enter the country illegally without processing their asylum requests. "},
{"text": "That power will apply when a daily threshold of 2,500 migrant \"encounters\" is reached. "},
{"text": "Removals are expected to take place within days, or even hours. The rule will not apply to migrants who arrive using legal pathways."},
{"text": "Notably, the executive order rests on a law - known as  212(f) - that allows a US president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country."},
{"text": "The same regulation was used by the Trump administration to ban immigration and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries and to bar migrants from asylum if they were apprehended crossing into the US illegally, prompting accusations of racism. "},
{"text": "In January 2019, the Trump administration implemented a policy - officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP - that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings. "},
{"text": "About 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the policy. They were often left there for months at a time and sometimes preyed upon by criminal gangs. "},
{"text": "Human Rights First, a charity organisation, estimated that more than 1,500 migrants were kidnapped, raped or abused after being returned to Mexico. "},
{"text": "Mr Biden called the policy \"inhumane\". "},
{"text": "The administration moved to suspend Remain in Mexico on Mr Biden's first day in the White House in January 2021. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved to officially terminate the policy in June the same year. "},
{"text": "But a ruling by a Trump-appointed federal court judge in Texas found that the administration had improperly cancelled the policy. It was restarted in December 2021. "},
{"text": "In June 2022, the US Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, ruling it didn't violate proper administrative procedure in rescinding Remain in Mexico. The ruling allowed the policy to be terminated. "},
{"text": "Under Trump, the US government had a \"zero-tolerance\" policy that allowed authorities to deport adults who crossed the border illegally."},
{"text": "In some cases parents were deported back to their home countries without their children, who were placed in government custody. "},
{"text": "Trump repeatedly defended - and continues to defend - the policy as a way to deter would-be migrants. "},
{"text": "At least 3,900 children were separated from their parents between 2017 and 2021."},
{"text": "Mr Biden reversed the practice and some families - but not all - have been reunited. "},
{"text": "While a task force has reunited most families, as of April 2024 nearly 1,400 children were still waiting - although about 300 of them were in the process of being reunited or their families had been contacted. "},
{"text": "In December 2021, the administration also moved to stop holding families in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.  "},
{"text": "Biden administration officials have noted that the president's new executive order includes exemptions for unaccompanied children and those suspected of being trafficked."},
{"text": "The Biden administration has also rolled out family reunification programmes for citizens of certain countries - including Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Colombia - who have relatives in the US. "},
{"text": "Trump made little use of parole - where the government allows migrants into the US even if they don't have a visa or can't qualify for one - compared to President Biden."},
{"text": "Instead, his administration led an effort to decrease the number of migrants on parole in the US and in 2018 announced the creation of the MPP programme, or \"Remain in Mexico\". "},
{"text": "Trump has said on the campaign trail that he would end the \"outrageous abuse of parole\" by President Biden. "},
{"text": "Mr Biden is said to be one of the presidents rely most on parole, a practice which has existed since the 1950s. That has prompted fierce criticism from Republicans and Trump. "},
{"text": "The use of parole by the Biden administration includes the humanitarian parole of migrants who have been detained, in particular when they are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country."},
{"text": "There are also special, targeted parole programmes for people of specific nationalities, including Afghans and Ukrainians. "},
{"text": "As many as 30,000 migrants a month are able to fly to the US legally on parole - with a sponsorship - under the programme for Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians. "},
{"text": "The administration argues it has helped reduce crossings at the Mexico-US borders, but it sparked a lawsuit from multiple Republican-led states. "},
{"text": "The scrapped border bill would have kept these programmes in place and allowed parole for those in humanitarian need, but broadly speaking would have restricted its use. "},

{"text": "It also would be a huge victory for the former president as he bids to return to the White House. While it is still legal for a convicted felon to run for US president, a guilty verdict could hurt his chances with voters."},

{"text": "According to the project\u2019s official website, the goal is ultimately to supply these comics to every school under Russian control."},
{"text": "The comics consist of 22 short stories dedicated to Russian servicemen decorated for their role in the war."},
{"text": "They echo the Kremlin's unfounded claim that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 prevented a \"genocide\u201d planned by Kyiv authorities in eastern Ukraine and backed by Nato countries."},
{"text": "Among the protagonists is Col-Gen Azatbek Omurbekov, the commanding officer of the unit responsible for the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha in 2022."},
{"text": "The comic book describes Mr Omurbekov as a \u201creal man\u201d and claims that his troops have shown \u201chumanity\u201d during the first months of the war in Ukraine."},
{"text": "\u201cAs they [Ukrainian soldiers] retreated, the enemy abandoned their wounded. Russian soldiers gave them first aid \u2013 even in war, one must remain human,\u201d the comic reads."},

{"text": "The books were written by Oleg Roy, a prominent Russian children\u2019s author and a vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine."},
{"text": "The comics employ the anti-Western, anti-Nato and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric long peddled by Russian authorities. \"Out of hatred for Russia, the West arms their puppy neo-Nazis in occupied Kyiv,\" one of the books reads."},
{"text": "Mr Roy previously created a series of comics devoted to patriotic \"Russian superheroes\" which were praised by Kremlin-backed media as Russia\u2019s \"answer to DC and Marvel\"."},
{"text": "In September 2023, another series of 23 war-themed comics was issued by prominent military blogger Mikhail Zvinchuk, who is also part of the Russian Presidential Council on the War in Ukraine. These comics were translated in English, Arabic and Chinese."},
{"text": "The stories they tell claim to be based on real-life situations from the war in Ukraine. They highlight the courage and determination of Russian soldiers, while derogatory language is used to describe Ukrainian soldiers, who are portrayed as pawns of Western generals."},
{"text": "Some of the stories also echo the narratives of Russian state-controlled media, claiming that Ukrainian soldiers lack the motivation to fight, as their commanding officers send them to die."},
{"text": "One of Zvinchuk\u2019s comic books describes the battle for the eastern Ukrainian village of Klischiivka, which Russia has since claimed to have captured."},
{"text": "It tells the story of a Ukrainian soldier named Mykola, who surrenders to Russian troops, shoots members of his own battalion and changes his name to Nikolai, the Russian variant of his name."},

{"text": "Mr Zvinchuk\u2019s comics were showcased as part of an art exhibition set up on a train that travelled across Russia."},

{"text": "According to official data, more than half a million people visited the Ministry of Defence-backed initiative, which was dubbed The Power of Truth. The train covered more than 34,000km (21,200 miles), stopping in more than 75 cities between Moscow and Russia\u2019s Far East."},
{"text": "Another series of Ukraine war-related comics is centred around the exploits of the Russian Wagner mercenary group and its late founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin - although this series appears to have no official backing. "},
{"text": "Wagner mercenaries have been involved in wars in Ukraine and in Syria. Prigozhin died in a plane crash on 23 August, exactly two months after he led a short-lived mutiny during which his fighters took over key military installations in southern Russia and began marching towards Moscow."},
{"text": "The comics \u2013 which were published at the end of 2023 on social media platform Telegram - glorify Wagner mercenaries and claim they saved Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine from \"genocide\"."},
{"text": "The protagonist is a Wagner mercenary called Angel of Wrath, who is depicted fighting blue dog-like creatures wearing the Ukrainian coat of arms."},
{"text": "In the comic, these creatures are seen turned into monsters because of the \u201cnew serum that the Americans are injecting them with\u201d."},

{"text": "Ukraine is now allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. What will this decision change and how will it affect the front line in Ukraine?"},
{"text": "Up until now, Western countries restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories. They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict."},
{"text": "But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyiv\u2019s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well."},
{"text": "Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border."},
{"text": "The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the ban on using Western weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment."},
{"text": "Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons."},
{"text": "\u201cThe hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet what\u2019s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday."},
{"text": "Just a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand \u201csanitary zones\u201d in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. "},
{"text": "He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have \u201cstates with small territories and dense population\u201d. "},
{"text": "\u201cThey must take this factor into consideration prior to discussing strikes deep inside the Russian territory,\u201d he added."},
{"text": "Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didn\u2019t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory."},
{"text": "Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border.  But this is still a major policy shift by Kyiv\u2019s main allies."},
{"text": "Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans."},
{"text": "Now, Ukraine can \u201cstrike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,\u201d says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east."},
{"text": "Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia was gathering its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive.  "},
{"text": "And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were \u201cexpanded activities at depots and warehouses\u201d in that area.  So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region."},
{"text": "Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns.  But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs."},
{"text": "The only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot.  However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk.  Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system."},
{"text": "Interestingly, the UK and France, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), haven\u2019t explicitly restricted their use.  And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:\u201cWe should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.\u201d"},
{"text": "And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviation officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.  So, he says, Ukraine can now hit airfields in the Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine."},
{"text": "However, such operations will be limited in terms of what they can achieve. Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year are better equipped for such tasks.  But President Zelensky admits that it\u2019s still not clear whether Ukraine\u2019s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia."},
{"text": "\u201cI think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,\u201d he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday."},
{"text": "Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russia\u2019s rear.  Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border.  "},

{"text": "These included being locked in a dark closet, being coerced to strip naked in front of fellow participants, and even being required to enact his own funeral. "},
{"text": "During these rituals, he was tasked with committing to paper his perceived flaws, such as \u201chomosexuality\u201d, \u201cabomination\u201d, \u201cfalsehood\u201d - and even more explicit terms, which he was then obliged to bury beneath a symbolic gravestone."},

{"text": "Today in Italy, it's nearly impossible to determine the precise extent of these practices, reported mostly by men, but some women too, and there is no standard legal definition of them."},
{"text": "In recent months, however, the BBC has conducted interviews with several young gay men across the country who have shared their experiences of being subjected to pseudoscientific group meetings or individual therapy sessions aimed at turning them into heterosexuals."},

{"text": "\u201cI saw that as my sole path to acceptance,\u201d said another. He was not trying to become a priest, but was simply seeking acceptance in his daily life."},
{"text": "Gay conversion therapy is not limited to one specific region of Italy - group meetings and individual therapy sessions run across the country, some even run by licensed psychotherapists. In some cases, these gatherings and therapy sessions are unofficial and covert, often promoted through discreet conversations and secret referrals."},

This group has since disbanded, having incurred the disapproval of the Catholic Church."},
{"text": "However, the Italian priest who originally pushed Lonegro into these practices was given a senior position within the Church, while others continued to draw inspiration from S\u00e1nchez Cord\u00f3n\u2019s methods in Italy."},
{"text": "Many of the people the BBC spoke to were referred to Luca di Tolve, a \u201cmoral/spiritual trainer\u201d who gained recognition through his book titled \"I was gay once. In Medjugorie I found myself\"."},
{"text": "On his website, Di Tolve and his wife boast that they are a \"contented couple\" seeking to \"aid anyone whose sexual identity is in turmoil, helping them to genuinely exercise their freedom in determining who they wish to be as a person\u201d. When contacted by the BBC, Di Tolve did not respond."},
{"text": "Another active individual promoting ways to tackle perceived sexual orientation is Giorgio Ponte, a well-known writer in Italy\u2019s ultra-conservative circles.

{"text": "\"In my experience, homosexual attraction stems from an injury to one's identity that conceals needs unrelated to the sexual-erotic aspect but rather tied to a distorted perception of oneself, reflecting across all aspects of life,\" he told the BBC."},
{"text": "\"I believe that a homosexual person should have the freedom to try [to become heterosexual], if they want, knowing, however, that it may not be possible for everyone,\" he added."},
{"text": "In recent years, dozens of young men and women have sought guidance from the likes of Di Tolve, Ponte and S\u00e1nchez Cord\u00f3n. Among them is 36-year-old Massimiliano Felicetti, a gay man who grappled with attempts to change his sexual orientation for more than 15 years. "},
{"text": "\u201cI started to be uncomfortable with myself from a very early age, I felt I would never be accepted by my family, society, Church circles. I thought I was wrong, I just wanted to be loved, and these people offered me hope,\" he said."},
{"text": "Felicetti said he had tried different solutions, consulting psychologists and clergy members who offered to help him become heterosexual. However, about two years ago, he decided to stop.

{"text": "Such lack of progress comes as no surprise to Michele Di Bari, a researcher in comparative public law at the University of Padova, who says that Italy is structurally much slower to implement change compared with other countries in Western Europe."},

{"text": "While he has lagged behind Joe Biden and the Democrats' fundraising efforts, the conviction injected new life into his electoral bid - with his campaign announcing that it raised nearly $53m (\u00a341.6m) in just 24 hours after the verdict. "},
{"text": "Israeli-American casino billionaire Miriam Adelson is expected to announce a multi-million dollar boost to Trump's campaign this week. "},
{"text": "According to US media reports, Mrs Adelson will donate to a political action committee called Preserve America. Political action committees can spend unlimited sums of money backing candidates for elected office. "},
{"text": "While it is unclear how much she plans to spend, Politico and other US news outlets have reported that the contribution is expected to exceed the $90m donation to Preserve America by Mrs Adelson and her late husband, Sheldon, ahead of the 2020 election. "},
{"text": "Others are likely to follow suit. In the hours following the verdict last week, a number of wealthy billionaires posted messages of support for Trump. "},
{"text": "Among them was Silicon Valley investor David Sacks, who posted on X, formerly Twitter, that there \"is now only one issue in this election: whether the American people will stand for the USA becoming a Banana Republic\". "},

{"text": "Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman - one of the most prominent billionaires on Wall Street - has already announced he will support Trump in the election. "},
{"text": "Like Mr Ackman, Mr Schwarzman had previously distanced himself from the ex-president. "},
{"text": "But in late May, Mr Schwarzman said that he shared \"the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction\". "},
{"text": "He also said the \"dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of the upcoming election with greater urgency\". "},
{"text": "Other prominent billionaires who have thrown their support behind Trump so far include hedge fund founders John Paulson and Robert Mercer, as well as fracking pioneer Harold Hamm and casino mogul Steve Wynn. "},
{"text": "Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz - who said after the US Capitol riot that he regretted voting for Trump in 2020 - has had a change of heart and hosted the former president at his oceanfront Florida mansion in March."},
{"text": "Elon Musk, on the other hand, has previously said he will not be donating to either candidate this electoral cycle, although he does plan to host a livestreamed town-hall style event with Trump. "},
{"text": "Similarly, billionaire tech financier and prominent Republican donor Peter Thiel has reportedly turned down requests to donate to the Trump campaign and was said not to be planning any contributions this electoral cycle. "},
{"text": "Shaun Maguire, a partner at prominent venture capital firm Sequoia, announced a $300,000 donation to Trump within minutes of last week's verdict, arguing that the trial was unfair. "},
{"text": "In a lengthy post on X, Mr Maguire outlined a number of reasons for supporting Trump, including the Biden administration's handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and \"weakness\" in the Middle East. "},
{"text": "The various legal cases against Trump, Mr Maguire added, also served as a  \"radicalising experience\". "},
{"text": "\"There's a real chance President Trump is convicted of felony charges and sentenced to prison,\" he wrote. \"Bluntly, that's part of why I'm supporting him. I believe our justice system is being weaponised against him.\""},
{"text": "To date, the Biden campaign has largely surpassed the Trump campaign as far as fundraising. "},
{"text": "By the end of April, the campaign had a record $192m cash-on-hand, compared to the Trump campaign's $93.1m. "},
{"text": "That same month, however, the Trump campaign raised $76m, surpassing their Democratic rivals for the first time in this election cycle. The Biden campaign raised $51m in April, sharply down from the $90m-plus raised a month earlier."},
{"text": "But despite all the fundraising, Professor Justin Buchler, a campaign finance expert from Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC: \"Money is not going to be determinative. "},
{"text": "\"The primary role of money in a campaign is to increase name recognition. Everybody already knows who Donald Trump and Joe Biden are.\" "},
{"text": "A review of data from CBS, the BBC's US partner, has found that Trump's fundraising tends to enjoy a boost during key moments in his various legal battles. "},

{"text": "By Mr Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time."},

{"text": "The third count is related to his possession of a firearm while alleged to have been a drug user. "},
{"text": "The gun was discarded and discovered at a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, prompting an investigation that ultimately led investigators back to the forms. "},
{"text": "To convict Mr Biden, prosecutors will have to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol. "},
{"text": "Additionally, they will have to prove that Mr Biden was a drug user or addicted to drugs, and took possession of the gun despite knowing as much. "},

{"text": "\u201cMy son, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s overtaken it. He\u2019s fixed it. He\u2019s worked on it.\u201d"},
{"text": "Four years ago, President Biden was responding to Trump\u2019s attacks on the debate stage. Now, however, his statement could be an attempt to defuse what is shaping up to be a politically fraught moment, where his son\u2019s troubled past - and, by extension, that of the entire Biden family - will be on full display."},
{"text": "Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, is expected to testify about her former husband\u2019s drug habit. Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden\u2019s brother Beau - with whom Hunter would later be romantically involved and who discarded the handgun in question in a Delaware bin - is also on the prosecution\u2019s list of witnesses."},
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a good look,\u201d says Kate Andersen Brower, who has written several books on US presidents, their families and first ladies. She says presidents have had to deal with family turmoil in the past. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter faced sibling embarrassments, for instance. "},
{"text": "For a president\u2019s child to face a criminal trial is completely unprecedented, however, and it has left the elder Biden walking a tightrope."},
{"text": "He spent time with his son in Delaware this weekend, and he stayed in Wilmington - where the trial will take place - on Sunday night. During jury selection on Monday, the Biden family was well represented."},
{"text": "But the president had already returned to Washington by then. While he has noted his support for his son, he is also keeping his distance from the case itself. "},
{"text": "But First Lady Jill Biden attended and sat behind Hunter. The two embraced during a morning break in court proceedings and again after the day concluded. She was joined by Hunter\u2019s current wife, Melissa Cohen Biden - who held his hand as he walked out of court - and his half-sister, Ashley Biden, and her husband."},
{"text": "Jill Biden married the president after his first wife, Hunter Biden\u2019s mother, died in a 1972 car accident in which Hunter and Beau were injured. The accident also took the life of their infant sister, Naomi."},
{"text": "The president regularly speaks about the closeness of his family - and has made this devotion part of his political identity. "},
{"text": "He talks about how he would take the train home from Washington to Delaware each night as a US senator so he could say goodnight to his children. He wrote a book about dealing with grief following Beau Biden\u2019s death from brain cancer in 2016 and has discussed the emotional trauma he experienced in the aftermath of his first wife\u2019s passing."},
{"text": "Now, the more tawdry aspects of the Biden family story will be on public display, such as text messages between Hunter Biden and his family - including intimate communication with Beau\u2019s widow. "},
{"text": "There will also be photographs and other details of Hunter Biden\u2019s crack cocaine use. Some of that was likely gleaned from a laptop computer, whose existence and contents became a controversial part of the final days of the 2020 presidential election."},
{"text": "The Hunter Biden trial comes on the heels of one of the biggest stories of the 2024 presidential election so far \u2013 Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. While the two cases are substantially different - charges against a candidate versus a candidate\u2019s son - the rhythm of the two trials will unavoidably lead to comparisons."},
{"text": "At the very least, the attention focused on the Biden family drama, and Hunter Biden\u2019s legal troubles, will shift the media focus from Trump. And the legal issues surrounding his son could make Mr Biden more reluctant to lean in to attacks on Trump\u2019s criminal conviction."},
{"text": "It may also be a significant distraction for the president heading into the last campaign of his political career."},
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult on a personal level for Biden,\u201d Brower says. \u201cHe has experience trying to wall off his personal life from his public life, but it\u2019s his only living son. It\u2019s got to be very taxing.\u201d"},
{"text": "There\u2019s another way Hunter Biden\u2019s legal drama differs from Trump\u2019s. The former president's three other criminal cases will probably not happen before November\u2019s election."},
{"text": "Hunter Biden, however, is also under indictment on federal tax charges, with a trial scheduled for September."},
{"text": "That case, dealing with an alleged failure to pay at least $1.4m in taxes over four years, might be more politically damaging for the president, given that it involves financial crimes rather than ones connected to his drug addiction."},
{"text": "\u201cTax evasion is much harder to make excuses about,\u201d says Brower."},
{"text": "If Hunter Biden is convicted in either federal trial, it is within his father\u2019s presidential power to pardon him."},

{"text": "Late last year, Emily Johnson took to Reddit to share her frustration with how expensive food in Canada has become."},
{"text": "She fixated on one grocer in particular: Loblaw, the dominant food retailer in Canada, boasting nearly 2,500 stores."},
{"text": "Her Reddit group - named LoblawsIsOutofControl - was filled with photos of grocery items for sale at seemingly egregious prices, like C$40 ($29.36; \u00a323.06) for 1.4 kilograms of chicken."},
{"text": "Soon after, Ms Johnson and others banded together to launch a nation-wide boycott against Loblaw, saying they were fed up with the disparity between rising food prices and record profits."},
{"text": "The company, which also operates pharmacy and discount grocery stores, "},
{"text": " - a nearly 10% increase from a year earlier."},
{"text": "As anger grew, the grocer\u2019s former president Galen Weston, who has defended the profits, became the de facto face of food inflation in Canada, thanks to his regular appearances in Loblaw commercials and his annual reported salary of C$8.4m."},
{"text": "Some even began selling T-shirts featuring a spoof \u201cRoblaw$\u201d logo, which were met with copyright infringement complaints from the grocer."},
{"text": "The boycott, which began in May and is set to continue indefinitely, has since sparked a national conversation on how groceries in Canada are priced, and why a company like Loblaw continues to be profitable as more Canadians struggle to afford food."},
{"text": "It has also ignited political pressure and scrutiny on the grocery practices of not just Loblaw, but other major grocers in the country."},
{"text": "\u201cGroceries did not used to be such an issue but the prices have skyrocketed this past year so we\u2019re going without anything frivolous,\u201d Terra Suffel, a 49-year-old single mother of two living in Toronto, told the BBC."},
{"text": "A C$200 shopping spree used to feed Ms Stuffel and her children for the entire week, she said. Now it barely covers lunch ingredients and much-needed pantry items."},
{"text": "\u201cWe can\u2019t really afford much meat and our main protein is now eggs,\u201d she said, adding that she, too, is boycotting Loblaw."},
{"text": "In response to frustrated Canadians like her, Canada\u2019s federal innovation minister has since taken several overseas trips to woo an international grocer to set up shop in Canada, in an attempt to increase competition and therefore drive down food prices."},
{"text": "But experts say that any foreign grocer looking to enter Canada\u2019s market faces an uphill battle to distinguish itself from existing players, and that the country\u2019s unaffordability crisis may require a more complex fix."},
{"text": "Loblaw has responded to the boycott by saying they remain committed to be the \u201cretailer of choice\u201d for Canadians."},
{"text": "In a statement to the BBC, the company added that it was doing what it could to fight inflation and plans on opening more discount stores to make affordable food more accessible."},
{"text": "Like many other countries, Canadians saw the cost of living go up after the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to supply-chain issues and labour shortages."},
{"text": "Although food inflation in Canada peaked at a lower mark, 11.4%, than in the UK and US, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the overall figure does not tell the whole story."},
{"text": "A price comparison between the three countries of some everyday items suggests Canada is indeed more expensive for some of those regular shopping basket contents."},
{"text": "Canadians are also grappling with a currency that is plummeting in value compared to the US dollar, which has impacted both the price of food imported from the US, as well as Canadians\u2019 overall purchasing power."},
{"text": "Rising interest rates, coupled with higher rent and home prices, have also pinched the wallets of many in Canada."},
{"text": "\u201cPeople are feeling (the rising cost of food) because they are also feeling the rise of mortgage payments and other things,\u201d said Jordan LeBel, a marketing professor with expertise in the food industry at Concordia University in Montreal."},
{"text": "Another issue is the heavily consolidated nature of Canada\u2019s grocery market, said Prof LeBel."},
{"text": "The country\u2019s industry is dominated by three large companies: Loblaw (which operates Loblaw's stores), Empire (which operates Sobeys stores) and Metro."},
{"text": "They make up nearly 60% of the grocery market share while Walmart and Costco make up much of the rest."},
{"text": "In comparison, the US grocery market features more regional players. And while Walmart is by far the most popular chain across the country, there are more than a dozen other grocers meaningfully competing with it."},
{"text": "Similarly, the UK\u2019s market is also diverse, with a total of 14 businesses turning over more than \u00a31bn in groceries sales per year."},
{"text": "Prof LeBel said the Loblaw boycott is a signal from Canadians who are fed-up with the lack of choice and the country\u2019s grocery behemoths, who lack an incentive to meaningfully tackle rising food costs."},
{"text": "Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of innovation, science and industry, has been tight-lipped on which international grocers he has been trying to court."},
{"text": "But government documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal in April have named 12 potential stores, including Germany\u2019s Aldi and Lidl, France\u2019s Les Mousquetaires, and other companies from Turkey, Spain and Portugal."},
{"text": "Discount supermarket chain Aldi already has nearly 2,400 stores in the US. It is also the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket."},
{"text": "Its chief competitor Lidl has a footprint in the UK and the US as well, though a smaller one than Aldi."},
{"text": "Despite their popularity in other countries, retail experts say entering the Canadian market comes with its own unique set of challenges."},
{"text": "\u201cThe classic mistake all foreign retailers make when coming to Canada is that they think it is the 51st US state,\u201d said Amarinder Singh, a senior director at consulting firm Kantar."},
{"text": "In reality, Canadian shoppers are very different, he said."},
{"text": "Their needs vary regionally, he said, whether they live in Atlantic Canada or in British Columbia, or whether they call a major metropolitan city like Toronto home."},
{"text": "Canada is also a highly multicultural country with 20% born elsewhere and a national grocer must target them to find success, Mr Singh said."},
{"text": "Another factor to consider is that Loblaw\u2019s strong loyalty points programme covers 40% of Canada\u2019s entire population."},
{"text": "\u201cThe issue is how you engage the shoppers, and how you steal the share from the Loblaws and Sobeys and Metros of the world, who have such a strong grasp on this market,\u201d said Mr Singh."},
{"text": "Some have said the minister\u2019s international tour is a bit of political theatre ahead of a consequential election for Canadians where the ruling Liberal Party is significantly lagging in the polls."},
{"text": "\u201cGoing after a big player, you have meetings, photo ops - it looks like you\u2019re doing something,\u201d Prof LeBel said."},
{"text": "A spokesperson Canada's department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Riyadh Nazerally, confirmed to the BBC that Minister Champagne has spoken to foreign retailers about \u201cpossible investments in Canada\u201d, but no further details."},
{"text": "Canada is working on other measures, like reforming its Competition Act to make it more friendly to new entrants, he added."},
{"text": "Prof LeBel said he believes the government should also focus on building up already-existing regional players and small, local grocers."},
{"text": "Experts have said that the impact of the boycott on Loblaw is likely limited. Local, independent grocers around the country, however, appear to be benefiting, with some seeing a significant boost in traffic and sales since the beginning of May. "},

{"text": "While the Ship pressed on out over the Atlantic, the lower-stage of the rocket headed back to a drop point near shore."},
{"text": "Using its engines, the booster deftly brought itself to a stop above the sea surface before pitching over. The manoeuvre was a prelude to future landings back at Boca Chica itself."},

{"text": "It's intended to operate much like an aeroplane that can be refuelled and put back in the air in quick order."},

{"text": "\"Sunday's attack in Rafah has caused widespread sadness\", he told BBC Arabic."},
{"text": "What makes it more shareable still, however, is the AI-generated image in the post itself, experts say."},

{"text": "Reacting to the criticism, the Malaysian artist who created the image - known by his username shahv4012 - wrote in an Instagram story quoted by Time magazine: \u201cThere are people who are not satisfied with the picture and template, I apologize if I have made a mistake on all of you.\""},
{"text": "But he added: \u201cWhatever [you do], don\u2019t look down on the Rafah issue now, spread it so that they are shaken and afraid of the spread of all of us.\u201d"},
{"text": "But while the image depicts a somewhat \"sanitised\" version of what is going on in Rafah, Dr Reilly says that could be an advantage from a digital activist's perspective in terms of its share-ability."},
{"text": "He explains that this is because the image does not contain graphic content that could lead to its removal from Instagram for infringing its terms of use guidelines, while also increasing awareness of the issue that activists seek to bring attention to."},
{"text": "Tools developed by Instagram have also contributed to taking the post viral."},
{"text": "When \"shahv4012\" published the picture, he used the \u201cAdd Yours\u201d feature, launched by Instagram in 2021, which allows other users to re-share the photo with just a couple of clicks."},

We submit that the crimes against humanity charged were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups pursuant to organisational policies. Some of these crimes, in our assessment, continue to this day."},
{"text": "\"My Office submits there are reasonable grounds to believe that SINWAR, DEIF and HANIYEH are criminally responsible for the killing of hundreds of Israeli civilians in attacks perpetrated by Hamas (in particular its military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades) and other armed groups on 7 October 2023 and the taking of at least 245 hostages. As part of our investigations, my Office has interviewed victims and survivors, including former hostages and eyewitnesses from six major attack locations: Kfar Aza; Holit; the location of the Supernova Music Festival; Be\u2019eri; Nir Oz; and Nahal Oz. The investigation also relies on evidence such as CCTV footage, authenticated audio, photo and video material, statements by Hamas members including the alleged perpetrators named above, and expert evidence."},
{"text": "\"It is the view of my Office that these individuals planned and instigated the commission of crimes on 7 October 2023, and have through their own actions, including personal visits to hostages shortly after their kidnapping, acknowledged their responsibility for those crimes. We submit that these crimes could not have been committed without their actions. They are charged both as co-perpetrators and as superiors pursuant to Articles 25 and 28 of the Rome Statute."},
{"text": "\"During my own visit to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri and Kibbutz Kfar Aza, as well as to the site of Supernova Music Festival in Re\u2019im, I saw the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability."},

My Office also continues to investigate reports of sexual violence committed on 7 October."},

These crimes, in our assessment, continue to this day."},
{"text": "\"My Office submits that the evidence we have collected, including interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video, photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group, shows that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival."},

The siege also included cutting off cross-border water pipelines from Israel to Gaza \u2013 Gazans\u2019 principal source of clean water \u2013 for a prolonged period beginning 9 October 2023, and cutting off and hindering electricity supplies from at least 8 October 2023 until today.

{"text": "I got back from a reporting trip to Jerusalem, with all the usual highs and lows, and with the backdrop of one of the world's most utterly enthralling cities. And I realised on my return that something that habitually accompanies me on such trips had been missing. "},
{"text": "Something that I have always somewhat resented, yet also jealously guarded as an essential part of who I am. "},
{"text": "My stutter. "},

{"text": "Having to find fresh phrases can be an asset for a reporter. So it was perfectly liveable-with and to be honest - after a lifetime of listening to that little voice - quite companionable. "},

{"text": "There have been times like this before, and it has always returned. But who knows - this time it might be for good.  "},
{"text": "And it makes me feel a little bereft. "},
{"text": "When I look back, I can't really remember how it started but I do know that it was - to me at least - a relatively unobtrusive part of my childhood.  "},
{"text": "I was lucky to have a relatively sheltered, privileged upbringing where if it was noted at all, it was seen as a vaguely charming mark of distinction. A musty old Classics teacher would tell me about the great Athenian rhetorician Demosthenes standing on the beach with stones in his mouth to cure his stutter. It didn't really appeal.  "},
{"text": "Any time there was some distance that needed to be bridged - like speaking on a phone or asking for a bus ticket - it could be a problem. Anything too formal, too. And I found early on that it was really a stammer, not a stutter. "},
{"text": "Words didn't fracture and become staccato. They simply sat in the path like great unblinking toads, slyly preventing anything from getting past. But a stutter always sounded classier to me, so I've stuck with that.  "},
{"text": "It's been everywhere with me - at school, university, work. It's been quite remarkably even-handed in showing up in formal or casual situations. And utterly capricious, suddenly coming up with an entirely new syllable or consonant to place out of bounds. "},
{"text": "People would ask: Is it nerves? Are you very anxious? Which would of course give me anxiety - so I never mentioned it. This meant that if suddenly, halfway through a sentence, I was struck dumb, people would react as if it were some biblical curse. "},
{"text": "Once in Jordan after a 12-hour bus journey through the endless scrubland from Riyadh, I was suddenly unable to sound out a single word, a great imaginary boulder having materialised on my tongue through the night.  "},
{"text": "Across the Middle East, beyond the endless strife and complication, certain things were at least clear to me - \"Lebanon\" was no problem, \"Iraq\" and \"Iran\" were easy - \"Israel\" too - \"Egypt\" a doddle - but \"Tunisia\", \"Tel Aviv\" and \"Turkey\" were temperamental, withdrawing access at a moment's notice. "},
{"text": "I would try to avoid listening to a fellow correspondent on the same story before going on air, in case my inner voice should triumphantly extricate the key word from their report and place it in quarantine. "},

{"text": "Maybe I was just holding onto it as a precious fragment of a long-lost self - a sense that there was always something latent and untapped that lay beyond the surface. A connection - semi secret - to entire worlds of people that were gone. "},
{"text": "As she sank ever deeper into Alzheimer's, my mother, who had helped make it so that I never felt it a burden or a hindrance, simply denied outright that my stutter had ever existed - a last link broken with the past. "},

{"text": "Despite all this, however, there seems little agreement about what should happen and when."},
{"text": "For the three European nations which will formally recognise the state of Palestine this week - Norway, Spain and Ireland - the focus is to revive discussion about a two-state solution, which for years has been little more than a slogan to which politicians pay lip service."},

{"text": "Not only is Israel denying the PA tax revenues, far-right Finance Minister Belazel Smotrich is also threatening to cut Palestinian banks off from their Israeli counterparts."},

{"text": "UK Treasury officials are understood to be preparing new forms of financial and technical support for the PA."},

We have got to get into that space, otherwise we will be dealing with this for the next 70 years.\""},
{"text": "Then there are voices from within Israel. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has issued a passionate denunciation of Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to set out a post-war plan. \"The 'day after Hamas' will only be achieved with Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza, accompanied by international actors, establishing a governing alternative to Hamas rule,\" he said.

{"text": "Fellow war cabinet member Benny Gantz has gone a step further, threatening to resign from the government unless Mr Netanyahu agreed a six-point plan by 8 June. That included a demilitarised Gaza and the establishment of a joint US, European, Arab and Palestinian administration."},

They fear - and wish to avoid - the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) running Gaza in the long run, which Mr Gallant said would be a \"dangerous course\" for which Israel would pay a heavy price in \"bloodshed and victims\"."},
{"text": "The United States shares this view. \"It is imperative not only that the conflict in Gaza ends as soon as possible, but that Israel comes forward with a clear plan for how Gaza is going to be governed, secured, redeveloped,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a Senate committee hearing this week."},
{"text": "Without that, he said, Israel would face unacceptable options: long-term military occupation and insurgency, the return of Hamas, or anarchy and lawlessness. \"We believe that Palestinians must be governed by themselves,\" he said."},
{"text": "The US is also putting pressure on Arab states to agree an international force that could establish security in Gaza in the short term. The US would not put its own troops on the ground but wants countries including Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain and the UAE to do so instead. But diplomats say these countries have made clear they would take part only if the West recognised the state of Palestine, there was an agreed pathway to a two-state solution, and they came at the invitation of some kind of Palestinian leadership."},
{"text": "\"'The day after' cannot be separated from the political process, it must be part of a comprehensive package,\" one Arab diplomat told me. \"No-one will put one foot on the ground unless there is a political process.\""},
{"text": "Some Arab states feel the US has been too focused on trying to secure a deal to normalise diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. They accept this may be key to getting Israel's agreement to a wider political settlement, but suspect it is seen too much as a \"silver bullet\" by some US officials. "},
{"text": "They also think the US needs to think harder about \"the day after\" for Israel, engaging more closely with moderate voices who could win popular support for a Palestinian-governed Gaza. There is discussion, too, about what role Turkey could play, using its leverage over Hamas to agree some kind of post-war deal."},
{"text": "Ultimately the key obstacle to any agreement is Benjamin Netanyahu. He refuses to discuss it apart from categorically opposing any role for the Palestinian Authority. He fears upsetting hard-right members of his government who favour long-term Israeli occupation. But pressure is rising on the prime minister, and one day he may have to choose."},
{"text": "\"The risk is that there is no 'day after',\" said one Western diplomat. \"Israel could do Rafah, Hamas would still be there, there could be another Rafah. The military campaign could go on for months.\""},

After paying a third of her earnings to the land owner, she was left with roughly US$1.5 [\u00a31.18] for that night's work. This is worth less than ever before, given inflation in Egypt is at an all-time high, and pickers are often living below the poverty line."},

Each year, it is the factories that set the price for the jasmine picked by people like Heba. "},
{"text": "It is difficult to say exactly how many of the 30,000 people involved in Egypt's jasmine industry are children. But during the summer of 2023 the BBC filmed across this region and spoke to many residents who told us the low price for jasmine meant they needed to include their children in their work. "},
{"text": "We witnessed that, at four different locations, a significant number of pickers working on smallholder farms - which supply the main factories - were children under the age of 15. Multiple sources also told us that there were children working on farms directly owned by the Machalico factory, so we went undercover to film there and found pickers who told us their ages ranged from 12 to 14.
